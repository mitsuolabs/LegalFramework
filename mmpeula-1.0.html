<strong>PRELIMINARY NOTICE TO LICENSEE — STRUCTURE, INTENT, AND READING GUIDANCE</strong>

This Agreement has been designed with the same precision and intentionality as the software it governs. Its structure, terminology, and level of detail are deliberate. Modern digital environments operate across multiple legal systems, technical standards, and operational contexts, and a professional‑grade license must reflect that reality. A shorter or simplified document would not provide the clarity, predictability, or legal stability required for responsible use.

To support comprehension, this Agreement is organized into Axioms. In mathematics, an axiom is a foundational principle: a clear, self‑contained rule upon which an entire system is built. Here, each Axiom serves a similar purpose. Instead of presenting a continuous block of legal text, the Agreement is divided into conceptual units. Each Axiom introduces one core idea at a time, allowing Licensee to understand the framework progressively and with reduced cognitive load.

This structure is intentional. It allows Licensee to navigate the Agreement efficiently, reference specific obligations without ambiguity, and understand the logic behind each provision. Many Licensees find that once the Axiom format is recognized, the document becomes significantly easier to follow, regardless of its length.

The level of detail included here exists to protect both parties. Clear definitions and explicit boundaries reduce operational risk, prevent misinterpretation, and ensure consistent application across teams, jurisdictions, and technical environments. Transparency at the outset minimizes uncertainty later.

Licensee is encouraged to proceed at a comfortable pace, We (MitsuoLabs™) and [[licensor-name]] suggests taking at least 14 days to truly understand the contract, but the minimum time required is 5 minutes (300 seconds). The Agreement is designed to be read in sections, and the Axiom structure allows Licensee to return to any part as needed. This document is intended to function not merely as a contract, but as a stable reference framework that supports informed, confident, and compliant use of the Covered Binaries.
<h3>AXIOM 1 – BINDING NATURE, PARTIES, AND ACCEPTANCE PROTOCOL</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Clause 1.1</strong> – Parties, scope, and nature of transaction This Agreement is entered into by and between: 
(a) Licensor, being [[licensor-name]], a legal entity duly organized and existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation, together with any affiliates expressly or impliedly empowered to distribute or license the Covered Binaries; 
and (b) Licensee, being any natural or legal person who installs, runs, executes, accesses, or otherwise interacts with any Covered Binary, whether directly or indirectly, whether on its own hardware or that of a third party, and whether for internal use, commercial use, academic use, professional use, or any other purpose whatsoever. For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is intended to apply primarily in a business‑to‑business (B2B) and professional context, and Licensee represents and warrants that it is not a “consumer” under the mandatory consumer protection laws of its jurisdiction where such characterization can be validly disclaimed in the context of software used in a professional capacity. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensee expressly agrees that this is not a personal or household transaction and that the Covered Binaries are professional or technical tools, not consumer products designed for leisurely or household use, and Licensee further acknowledges that any contrary assertion may be used by Licensor as evidence of misrepresentation by Licensee in any dispute or proceeding.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 1.2</strong> – Global application and jurisdictional layering This Agreement is drafted with the explicit intent to be globally applicable and jurisdictionally layered, operating concurrently under: (i) the laws of the Federative Republic of Brazil; (ii) the laws of the United States of America, including federal law and, where relevant, the law of a specific state identified by the Licensor or applicable conflict‑of‑laws rules; (iii) the laws of Member States of the European Union and supranational EU law to the extent applicable; and (iv) the laws of any other jurisdiction in which Licensee uses the Covered Binaries, solely to the extent that such laws are mandatorily applicable and non‑waivable. To the extent that any mandatory local law directly conflicts with any provision of this Agreement, such provision shall be modified to the minimal degree required for compliance while preserving, to the greatest extent legally permitted, the risk allocations, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and procedural protections intended by Licensor. This layered approach is designed such that, should any court, arbitrator, or authority determine that a provision is invalid in one jurisdiction, such determination shall not, by itself, affect the enforceability of the same provision in other jurisdictions where it remains lawful and valid.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 1.3</strong> – Acceptance, click‑through, and constructive assent Licensee acknowledges that this Agreement is presented to it in connection with installation, initial execution, or initial use of a Covered Binary, and that acceptance shall occur through one or more of the following mechanisms: (i) Licensee’s explicit indication of consent via an “Accept”, “I Agree”, or similarly labeled button; (ii) Licensee’s completion of a mandatory sequence of digital checkboxes affirming understanding and agreement on key contractual points; (iii) Licensee’s continued use of a Covered Binary after being reasonably notified of the existence and availability of this Agreement; or (iv) any other conduct that, under applicable law, reasonably evidences assent to contractual terms, including but not limited to installation, execution, or repeated utilization of the Covered Binaries in a professional or organizational setting. Licensee expressly agrees that any individual who performs such actions on its behalf is presumed authorized to bind Licensee, and Licensee shall bear the risk and consequences of any internal lack of authority, except where prohibitions on such presumption are strictly mandated by non‑waivable statutory law.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 1.4</strong> – Five‑minute mandatory review period Licensor has designed, or may design, the user interface of installers, launchers, or similar mechanisms for the Covered Binaries such that any means of acceptance, including “Accept” buttons or equivalent, remain disabled for a non‑skippable period of at least three hundred (300) seconds from the moment this Agreement is first displayed in a reasonably legible form. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that this five‑minute delay is intended to provide a meaningful opportunity to read and consider this Agreement before accepting, and that Licensee’s decision to wait out this period and then proceed with acceptance constitutes strong evidence that Licensee has been afforded adequate review time. Licensee agrees not to assert, in any forum, that it was technically prevented from reading this Agreement before acceptance, and acknowledges that any claimed failure to read is a unilateral decision for which Licensee alone is responsible. To the extent permitted by law, Licensee waives any argument that the review period was insufficient, recognizing that ordinary commercial practice often allows much shorter or even immediate acceptance without such enforced waiting.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 1.5</strong> – Seven mandatory checkbox affirmations In addition to the five‑minute delay, Licensee acknowledges that it will be required to actively toggle seven distinct digital checkboxes, each associated with a key legal point, before being permitted to click “Accept” or equivalent. By toggling each checkbox, Licensee (and the individual acting on its behalf) makes an explicit, separate affirmation that it has read, understood, and agreed to the corresponding provision as summarized on‑screen. Licensee further agrees that such separate affirmations may be relied upon by Licensor in any legal, arbitral, or administrative proceeding, and that they operate as independent confirmations that reduce or eliminate the credibility of any later claim of ignorance, mistake, or misunderstanding. While nothing in this Agreement can entirely prevent a court from examining issues such as fraud, coercion, or gross error where non‑waivable law so requires, Licensee acknowledges that the checkboxes are designed to minimize any plausible contention that this Agreement or its risk allocations were inconspicuous, hidden, or unknowingly accepted.

<p>
<strong>Clause 1.6 – Non‑consumer, professional‑use declaration Licensee explicitly represents and warrants that the Covered Binaries are being obtained, installed, and used solely in the course of its professional, academic, technical, governmental, or organizational activities, and not primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, except where such characterization cannot legally be disclaimed. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Licensee hereby irrevocably waives the application of consumer‑protection statutes that would otherwise apply based on individual consumer status, including but not limited to Brazil’s Consumer Defense Code (Código de Defesa do Consumidor), European consumer directives, or U.S. state consumer statutes, where such waiver is available for professional or non‑consumer transactions. Where such waiver is not permitted, the relevant mandatory consumer protections shall apply only to the minimal legally required extent, and shall not be construed to invalidate the remainder of this Agreement or its central allocations of risk, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</strong>

<h3>AXIOM 2 – DEFINITIONS, INTERPRETATION, AND PLACEHOLDERS</h3> 
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 2.1</strong> – Definitions of key terms For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, regardless of capitalization, gender, or number, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) “Covered Binary” means any compiled, linked, or otherwise executable file, including dynamic or static libraries, command line programs, services, daemons, background tasks, or GUI applications, that Licensor distributes in object‑code or machine‑executable form; (b) “Source Components” means any source code, scripts, configuration files, build recipes, or documentation licensed under one or more separate source licenses referenced by placeholder in this Agreement; (c) “Source License” means any open‑source, proprietary, or mixed license identified via placeholder tags such as [SOURCE_LICENSE_REFERENCE], which govern the Source Components and may differ from this Agreement; (d) “Documentation” means any explanatory materials, whether in textual, graphical, audiovisual, or interactive format, provided by Licensor to facilitate understanding or use of the Covered Binaries; (e) “User Data” means any data or information that Licensee submits to, processes with, or stores through the Covered Binaries; and (f) “Intellectual Property Rights” means all worldwide rights in patents, patent applications, utility models, copyrights, neighboring rights, moral rights (to the extent waivable), trademarks, trade names, trade dress, trade secrets, database rights, and any other similar or analogous rights recognized now or hereafter under any legal system.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 2.2</strong> – Interpretation and hierarchy of documents This Agreement is intended to function as a master EULA for multiple projects and binaries. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between: (i) the main body of this Agreement (Axioms 1–33); (ii) its Appendices; (iii) any project‑specific EULA, license notice, or terms embedded in or displayed by a specific Covered Binary; and (iv) any Source License governing Source Components, the following hierarchy shall apply to the extent allowed by law: first, mandatory, non‑waivable statutory provisions; second, the specific terms of the relevant Source License with respect to the Source Components only; third, any project‑specific EULA or additional terms explicitly identified as superseding this master Agreement; fourth, the main body of this Agreement; and finally, the Appendices. Licensee acknowledges that some Source Components may be subject to open‑source licenses that grant rights more extensive than those granted herein, and in such cases, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to restrict or curtail any rights that Licensee holds under such open‑source licenses with respect to the corresponding Source Components.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 2.3</strong> – Placeholders and dynamic references This Agreement uses placeholders such as 
[[product-name]], [[license-fee-schedule]], [[project-family-name]], [[source-license-reference]], [[licensor-contact-address]], [[designated-jurisdiction]], [[consumer-declaration-address]], and similar tokens that may be substituted, at or before the time of distribution, by concrete values in documentation, installers, or on‑screen notices. Licensee agrees that such substitutions, whether made automatically by build tools or manually by Licensor, shall be deemed integral parts of this Agreement for the relevant Covered Binary. In case of any ambiguity or omission where a placeholder is not replaced, the interpretation most consistent with preserving Licensor’s intended risk allocation and intellectual property protections shall prevail, except where a mandatory principle of transparency requires an interpretation more favorable to Licensee. However, the mere presence of an unreplaced placeholder shall not by itself invalidate the Agreement or render it entirely unenforceable; rather, a court or arbitrator shall fill such gaps in a manner consistent with common industry practice and the evident structure of this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 2.4</strong> – Language versions and translation This Agreement may be made available in multiple language versions, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, Spanish, and other languages. Unless otherwise mandated by local law, the English version shall serve as the primary reference for purposes of interpretation in international contexts and arbitration administered in English. For disputes subject to Brazilian law and conducted in Portuguese, a Portuguese version may be designated as controlling. Licensee acknowledges that translations may involve nuances and that, in the event of a conflict between language versions, the version explicitly designated as “controlling” in the relevant jurisdiction shall prevail. Where no controlling version is expressly designated, the version most closely aligned with the Licensor’s principal place of business, as evidenced by registration or incorporation documents, shall be used as the interpretative reference, and Licensee agrees not to exploit minor discrepancies between translations as a basis for claiming ambiguity where the substantive intent is reasonably clear.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 2.5</strong> – No implied waiver, no contra proferentem against Licensor in B2B In a B2B or professional context, Licensee acknowledges that it often possesses or has access to legal counsel and technical expertise. Therefore, to the extent allowed by applicable law, the doctrine of contra proferentem (interpreting ambiguities against the drafter) shall not automatically apply against Licensor in disputes involving professional or organizational Licensees. Instead, ambiguous terms shall be interpreted in a manner that best aligns with the overall structure of this Agreement, its Appendices, and any relevant Source Licenses, and in a manner that preserves the central goals of limiting Licensor’s liability, ensuring clear allocation of risk, and safeguarding the integrity of Licensor’s Intellectual Property Rights. Furthermore, no failure or delay by Licensor in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver thereof, and a single or partial exercise shall not preclude any further or other exercise of that or any other right or remedy available at law, in equity, or under this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 2.6</strong> – Severability and blue‑pencil reformation If any provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is held by a court, arbitrator, or competent authority to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction, such provision shall be reformed, modified, or reduced solely in that jurisdiction to the minimal degree necessary to render it valid and enforceable, while preserving as much as possible the original economic and risk‑allocation intent. If such modification is not legally feasible, the provision shall be severed in that jurisdiction, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The parties expressly agree that the disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution clauses set forth in this Agreement are fundamental, essential elements of the bargain, and that any attempt to strike them in their entirety should be accompanied, where legally possible, by a reduction of Licensor’s obligations or an adjustment of any price paid. This blue‑pencil mechanism is intended to enhance enforceability worldwide and shall not be construed as an invitation to reconstruct the Agreement in a manner that fundamentally alters the risk profile originally contemplated by Licensor.

<h3>AXIOM 3 – LICENSE GRANT FOR COVERED BINARIES </h3>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 3.1</strong> – Nature of license grant Subject to Licensee’s full, continuous compliance with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a personal, limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable, revocable license to install, load, and execute the Covered Binaries, in object‑code or machine‑executable form only, on hardware owned, leased, or otherwise legitimately controlled by Licensee, solely for the purposes and within the usage parameters set forth in this Agreement and, where applicable, in project‑specific notices. This license grant does not constitute a sale or transfer of ownership of any Covered Binary, nor of any Intellectual Property Rights embodied therein; rather, it is a purely contractual permission, which may be terminated in accordance with the termination provisions herein. Licensee acknowledges that any rights not expressly granted in this clause or elsewhere in this Agreement are reserved by Licensor, and that any use beyond the scope of this grant constitutes an infringement of Licensor’s Intellectual Property Rights and/or a material breach of this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 3.2</strong> – Scope: personal, organizational, and multi‑device use Where Licensee is a natural person using the Covered Binaries strictly in a professional capacity (such as a consultant, contractor, or employee), this Agreement authorizes Licensee to install and use the Covered Binaries on multiple devices under Licensee’s direct control, provided that such use is limited to Licensee’s own professional activities and does not permit concurrent use by other individuals beyond those explicitly licensed by Licensor. Where Licensee is a legal entity (such as a corporation, partnership, or government agency), the scope of use shall be constrained to the number of users, devices, or instances set forth in any applicable order form, invoice, or licensing documentation; if no such explicit limitation exists, the license shall be deemed limited to the internal use of the Covered Binaries by Licensee’s personnel in the ordinary course of its professional activities, excluding any provision of the Covered Binaries as a service to third parties. In all cases, any attempt to pool, share, or extend usage beyond the authorized scope, especially for the purpose of providing services or tools to unrelated third parties, shall be treated as an unauthorized expansion of the license.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 3.3</strong> – Prohibited uses and technical restrictions Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, directly or indirectly: (a) modify, adapt, translate, alter, or create derivative works of any Covered Binary, except to the limited extent (if any) explicitly allowed by applicable law that cannot be contractually waived; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive or extract the source code, structure, or algorithms of any Covered Binary, except to the minimal extent that mandatory law permits such actions for interoperability purposes and only after providing advance written notice to Licensor and allowing Licensor a reasonable opportunity to offer alternative means of achieving such interoperability; (c) circumvent, disable, or interfere with any technical protection measure, license enforcement mechanism, usage logging, or security feature built into a Covered Binary; (d) use any Covered Binary to create, train, or refine machine learning models or other analytical systems that compete, or may reasonably be perceived to compete, with Licensor’s offerings; or (e) utilize any Covered Binary in high‑risk environments (such as life‑critical systems, aviation control, nuclear facilities, or medical devices) unless Licensor has provided explicit, written authorization for such use, accompanied by appropriately tailored risk disclosures and conditions.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 3.4</strong> – Internal services vs. external service provision Licensee may, in the normal course of its operations, use the Covered Binaries to generate internal reports, analyses, artifacts, or other outputs that it may then provide to its customers or stakeholders as part of its services, provided that such use does not involve redistributing the Covered Binaries themselves, granting direct access to them, or effectively operating a “service bureau” or software‑as‑a‑service offering where third parties substantially interact with or rely on the Covered Binaries as a core component. To the extent that Licensee wishes to offer the Covered Binaries, or functionality substantially derived from them, as a hosted service, embedded solution, or commercial platform to third parties, such use shall require a separate written agreement with Licensor specifying fees, support obligations, and other material terms. Absent such an agreement, any attempt to provide the Covered Binaries as a service to third parties shall be deemed an unauthorized commercialization, and Licensor shall be entitled to pursue all available contractual, statutory, and equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and damages based on the fair market value of such unlicensed usage.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 3.5</strong> – Open‑source components and coexistence of licenses The Covered Binaries may incorporate, statically or dynamically link to, or otherwise depend on one or more open‑source or third‑party components governed by their own licenses. Licensee acknowledges that such components are not always governed by this Agreement but by the respective Source Licenses identified in documentation, notices, or source code repositories. To the extent that a Source License grants Licensee rights to copy, modify, or redistribute the relevant component beyond what is granted here, nothing in this Agreement shall limit those rights with respect to that component alone. However, Licensee also acknowledges that such rights do not automatically extend to Licensor’s proprietary components, trade secrets, or non‑open‑source portions of the Covered Binaries. Licensee undertakes to respect all applicable Source Licenses, including obligations related to attribution, disclosure of modifications, or copyleft provisions where relevant, and agrees that failure to do so may constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may also expose Licensee to independent claims from third‑party rights holders.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 3.6</strong> – Reservation of rights and future modifications Licensor reserves the right, at any time and in its sole discretion, to modify, update, or discontinue any Covered Binary, including by releasing new versions, patches, or variants that are subject to modified license terms. Unless otherwise stated, Licensee’s continued use of updated or replacement Covered Binaries after being made aware of new terms will be deemed acceptance of those terms, which shall then become part of, or supersede portions of, this Agreement for such binaries. No such modification shall retroactively deprive Licensee of rights already exercised under a prior version of the Agreement, but Licensor may condition access to updates and ongoing support on acceptance of revised terms. Licensee understands that software evolves, and that Licensor’s ability to maintain, secure, and improve the Covered Binaries may depend on periodically adjusting contractual terms to better reflect technological, regulatory, and commercial realities. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Licensor. 
</p>

<h3>AXIOM 4 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OWNERSHIP, AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 4.1</strong> — Ownership and title Licensor, or its licensors, affiliates, or assigns, retains and shall retain at all times all right, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Covered Binaries, the Documentation, any associated trademarks, trade names, trade dress, logos, design elements, build systems, packaging, and any derivative works, improvements, or modifications thereof, whether created by Licensor, its contractors, or by Licensee under any permitted collaboration; nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to transfer ownership of any such rights to Licensee, and any purported assignment, sale, or transfer by Licensee of any such rights shall be void ab initio and of no legal effect. Licensee acknowledges that the license granted herein is a limited contractual permission to use the Covered Binaries in object‑code form only and that Licensor expressly reserves all rights not expressly granted; Licensee further agrees that it shall not challenge Licensor’s ownership or the validity of any Intellectual Property Rights in any forum, except to the extent that such challenge is required by mandatory law and pursued in good faith.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 4.2</strong> — Marks, branding, and attribution Licensee shall not remove, alter, obscure, or otherwise tamper with any proprietary notices, copyright statements, trademark legends, or other proprietary markings embedded in or distributed with the Covered Binaries or Documentation, including but not limited to binary headers, resource strings, splash screens, or packaging metadata. Where Licensor provides a mechanism for Licensee to display Licensor’s marks or attributions in connection with permitted uses, such display shall be in accordance with Licensor’s brand guidelines and shall not be used in any manner that disparages, dilutes, or otherwise harms Licensor’s reputation or goodwill. Any goodwill arising from Licensee’s use of Licensor’s marks shall inure solely to the benefit of Licensor. Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor of any known or suspected infringement, misappropriation, or unauthorized use of Licensor’s Intellectual Property Rights and shall reasonably cooperate with Licensor, at Licensor’s expense, in any enforcement action.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 4.3</strong> — Feedback, contributions, and assignment Any feedback, suggestions, bug reports, feature requests, or other contributions that Licensee or any of Licensee’s personnel provide to Licensor regarding the Covered Binaries or Documentation (collectively, “Feedback”) shall be provided on a non‑confidential basis unless otherwise agreed in writing, and Licensee hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to Licensor all right, title, and interest in and to such Feedback, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein, without further consideration. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor may freely use, modify, exploit, and commercialize such Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, and Licensee waives any moral rights or attribution claims with respect to such Feedback to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If any jurisdiction prohibits such assignment, Licensee grants Licensor an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free, worldwide license to use the Feedback for any purpose.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 4.4</strong> — Source components and dual licensing placeholders Certain Covered Binaries may incorporate Source Components governed by separate Source Licenses identified by placeholder tags such as [SOURCE_LICENSE_REFERENCE]. To the extent that any Source License imposes obligations that are inconsistent with the proprietary protections Licensor asserts over its proprietary components, the parties agree that such Source License obligations shall apply only to the Source Components and shall not be interpreted to extend rights to Licensor’s proprietary code beyond what the Source License expressly requires. Licensee shall comply with all obligations imposed by applicable Source Licenses, including but not limited to attribution, distribution of license texts, and disclosure of modifications where required; however, Licensee acknowledges that the presence of Source Components does not convert the Covered Binaries into open‑source software in their entirety, and Licensor’s proprietary components remain governed exclusively by this Agreement unless otherwise expressly stated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 4.5</strong> — Enforcement and injunctive relief Licensee acknowledges that any breach of Licensor’s Intellectual Property Rights or any unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, or reverse engineering of the Covered Binaries may cause irreparable harm to Licensor for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, Licensor shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, or other provisional remedies to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation, without the requirement to post bond or other security to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Licensee agrees that Licensor’s pursuit of injunctive relief shall not preclude Licensor from seeking monetary damages or other remedies for the same conduct.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 4.6</strong> — Third‑party claims and cooperation If any third party asserts a claim that the Licensee’s use of a Covered Binary infringes or misappropriates any third‑party Intellectual Property Rights, Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor in writing and shall provide Licensor with reasonable cooperation and assistance, at Licensor’s expense, in defending or resolving such claim. Licensor shall have the exclusive right, at its option and expense, to defend, settle, or otherwise resolve any such claim, provided that Licensor shall not settle any claim that imposes any obligation or liability on Licensee without Licensee’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Licensee shall not, without Licensor’s prior written consent, make any admission of liability or enter into any settlement that affects Licensor’s rights.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>AXIOM 5 — PRIVACY, DATA HANDLING, AND CONSENT-BASED TELEMETRY</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 5.1</strong> — Principle of Consent and Revocability Licensor affirms that the guiding principle for all data collection is the Licensee’s explicit, informed, and revocable consent. The Covered Binaries, in their default configuration, shall not transmit any usage metrics, system information, or other telemetry data to Licensor or its agents. Any and all telemetry features are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the Licensee through an opt-in mechanism.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 5.2</strong> — Optional Telemetry Implementation Where Licensor offers optional diagnostic, analytics, or support features, such features shall be strictly opt-in. Enabling them requires a separate, explicit consent flow that is distinct from the acceptance of this Agreement. This consent flow will clearly describe: a) The specific categories of data to be collected. b) The precise purpose of the collection (e.g., bug fixing, feature improvement). c) The data retention period. d) The identities of any third-party service providers who may receive the data. licensee retains the right to enable or disable such optional features at any time through reasonably accessible controls within the software. Licensor shall not condition access to critical security updates or essential functionality on Licensee’s consent to optional telemetry.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 5.3</strong> — User Data; Licensee Control and Responsibility Licensee retains sole ownership, control, and responsibility for any and all data, content, or information created, processed, stored, or transmitted by Licensee in connection with the Covered Binaries ("User Data"). Licensor claims no rights to User Data and has no access to it, except where Licensee explicitly provides it for the purposes of technical support or other agreed-upon services.
<hr>
<h3>AXIOM 6 — WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS, AND PROFESSIONAL USE</h3> 
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 6.1</strong> — Limited warranty for media and delivery To the extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor warrants that, for a period of thirty (30) days following initial delivery of a Covered Binary to Licensee, the Covered Binary will materially conform to the Documentation provided by Licensor at the time of delivery. This limited warranty applies only if Licensee notifies Licensor in writing of any non‑conformity within the warranty period and provides Licensor with reasonable access to reproduce the issue. Licensor’s sole obligation under this limited warranty shall be, at Licensor’s option, to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non‑conformity, provide a workaround, or replace the Covered Binary with a functionally equivalent version. This limited warranty shall not apply to defects resulting from (a) Licensee’s misuse, negligence, or unauthorized modification; (b) use in combination with hardware, software, or data not specified in the Documentation; (c) third‑party components governed by separate Source Licenses; or (d) any free or beta releases expressly provided “as is.”
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 6.2</strong> — Express disclaimers and “as is” provision EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN CLAUSE 6.1, THE COVERED BINARIES, DOCUMENTATION, AND ANY OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED BY LICENSOR ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON‑INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE COVERED BINARIES WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED, BE ERROR‑FREE, OR BE FREE FROM VULNERABILITIES OR SECURITY FLAWS. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE COVERED BINARIES ARE PROFESSIONAL TOOLS AND THAT LICENSEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VALIDATING THEIR SUITABILITY FOR LICENSEE’S PURPOSES.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 6.3</strong> — No professional advice; independent verification Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any outputs, calculations, analyses, or recommendations produced by the Covered Binaries are for informational or operational purposes only and do not constitute legal, financial, medical, accounting, or other professional advice. Licensee shall obtain and rely upon the advice of qualified professionals where appropriate and shall independently verify any material outputs before acting upon them. Licensor expressly disclaims any responsibility for decisions made or actions taken by Licensee or third parties based on the outputs of the Covered Binaries, and Licensee agrees to assume all risks associated with such reliance.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 6.4</strong> — Compatibility and environment disclaimers Licensor does not warrant that the Covered Binaries are compatible with all hardware, operating systems, virtualization platforms, container runtimes, or third‑party software configurations. Licensee is responsible for ensuring that its environment meets the minimum requirements specified in the Documentation and for performing appropriate testing prior to deploying the Covered Binaries in production or mission‑critical environments. Where Licensee elects to deploy the Covered Binaries in high‑availability, safety‑critical, or regulated contexts, Licensee shall implement appropriate redundancy, validation, and monitoring measures and shall not rely solely on the Covered Binaries for safety‑critical decision‑making absent explicit written authorization from Licensor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 6.5</strong> — Exclusions for open‑source and third‑party components To the extent that any Source Components included in the Covered Binaries are governed by separate Source Licenses, Licensor’s warranties, if any, with respect to such components shall be limited to those expressly provided by the respective licensors of those components. Licensor disclaims any warranty for third‑party components beyond what the third‑party licensors provide, and Licensee agrees to look solely to such third parties for any warranty claims related to those components. Where applicable law mandates certain warranties for third‑party components, such mandatory warranties shall apply only to the minimal extent required and shall not expand Licensor’s obligations under this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 6.6</strong> — Exclusive remedies and limitation of warranty remedies Licensee’s exclusive remedies for breach of the limited warranty set forth in Clause 6.1 shall be limited to the remedies expressly provided therein. Except as expressly provided in Clause 6.1, Licensor’s entire liability and Licensee’s exclusive remedy for any breach of warranty, whether arising in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be limited to the repair, replacement, or refund of the license fee actually paid for the Covered Binary in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or, if no fee was paid, to a nominal sum not to exceed the minimum amount permitted by applicable law. This limitation is intended to allocate risk and is a material inducement for Licensor to make the Covered Binaries available on the terms set forth herein. AXIOM 7 — SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, UPDATES, AND PATCH MANAGEMENT Clause 7.1 — Support offerings and optional service agreements Licensor may, at its sole discretion, offer one or more tiers of support, maintenance, or professional services (collectively, “Support Services”) to Licensee under separate written agreements or order forms that specify scope, service levels, fees, response times, and escalation procedures. Unless Licensee and Licensor have executed a separate Support Services agreement, Licensor shall have no obligation to provide any technical support, updates, patches, or maintenance for the Covered Binaries beyond those expressly provided in the Documentation or as required by mandatory law. Any Support Services provided on a time‑and‑materials basis shall be billed in accordance with Licensor’s then‑current rates and invoicing practices, and Licensee shall pay all undisputed invoices within the payment terms specified therein. Support Services agreements may include additional confidentiality, data processing, and liability provisions that supplement and, where expressly stated, supersede the terms of this Agreement for the duration of the support engagement.
</p>
<h>
<strong>Clause 7.2 — Updates, patches, and security fixes; optional consent for non‑telemetry updates Licensor may from time to time make available updates, patches, hotfixes, or new releases of the Covered Binaries (collectively, “Updates”) to address security vulnerabilities, defects, or to provide enhancements. Licensor shall not, by virtue of providing Updates, be deemed to have assumed any additional warranty or support obligations beyond those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any separate Support Services agreement. Where an Update materially alters the functionality, licensing terms, or introduces new optional features (including any optional telemetry or networked features), Licensor shall provide reasonable notice and, where required by applicable law or by the terms of this Agreement, obtain Licensee’s separate consent prior to enabling such features. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may, without Licensee’s consent, issue critical security patches that are necessary to remediate actively exploited vulnerabilities; Licensor will endeavor to provide prior notice where practicable and to minimize operational disruption.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 7.3</strong> — Distribution mechanisms and integrity assurances Updates and other deliverables may be distributed via Licensor’s designated distribution channels, which may include downloadable packages, signed binaries, cryptographic checksums, or other integrity mechanisms. Licensee agrees to verify the integrity and authenticity of any Update using the mechanisms provided by Licensor prior to deployment. Licensor shall use commercially reasonable measures to sign or otherwise authenticate Updates to reduce the risk of tampering or supply‑chain compromise. Licensee acknowledges that the security of its deployment environment, update pipelines, and verification processes is its responsibility, and Licensor shall not be liable for damages arising from Licensee’s failure to validate or securely apply Updates.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 7.4</strong> — Backward compatibility and deprecation policy Licensor may, in its discretion, deprecate older versions of Covered Binaries or discontinue support for legacy platforms, operating systems, or runtime environments. Licensor will endeavor to publish a deprecation policy and reasonable timelines in Documentation or release notes; however, Licensor shall have no obligation to maintain backward compatibility indefinitely. Licensee is responsible for planning and executing migrations to supported versions and for testing Updates in non‑production environments prior to production deployment. Where Licensor elects to remove functionality or discontinue a feature, Licensor shall, to the extent commercially reasonable, provide migration guidance and reasonable transition assistance under a separate agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 7.5</strong> — Emergency response and coordinated disclosure In the event that a security vulnerability or critical defect is discovered that materially affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the Covered Binaries, Licensor may, at its option, coordinate a responsible disclosure process with Licensee and relevant third parties. Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor of any suspected vulnerability and shall cooperate in good faith with Licensor’s investigation. Licensor may, where appropriate, issue advisories, mitigations, or patches and may coordinate timing of public disclosures to allow for remediation. Neither party shall publicly disclose details of a vulnerability in a manner that would materially increase risk to users without first providing reasonable opportunity for remediation, except where required by law or by a competent authority.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 7.6</strong> — Fees, invoicing, and suspension for non‑payment Where Licensee has contracted for paid Updates, Support Services, or other paid offerings, Licensor shall invoice Licensee in accordance with the applicable order form or invoice schedule. Unless otherwise agreed, all fees are non‑refundable and exclusive of taxes, duties, and other governmental charges, which shall be Licensee’s responsibility. Licensor reserves the right to suspend access to paid Updates, Support Services, or distribution channels if Licensee fails to pay undisputed amounts within the agreed payment period, provided that Licensor gives Licensee at least ten (10) days’ written notice and an opportunity to cure. Suspension for non‑payment shall not relieve Licensee of its payment obligations and shall not constitute termination of this Agreement unless Licensor elects to terminate in accordance with the termination provisions herein.

<h3>
AXIOM 8 — FEES, PAYMENT TERMS, TAXES, AND AUDIT RIGHTS 
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 8.1</strong> — License fees and fee schedules; placeholders Licensee shall pay to Licensor the license fees, subscription fees, or other charges set forth in the applicable order form, invoice, or [[license-fee-schedule]] (collectively, “License Fees”). Unless otherwise specified, License Fees are due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date and shall be paid in the currency specified by Licensor. All License Fees are non‑refundable except as expressly provided in this Agreement or required by mandatory law. Where Licensee fails to timely pay undisputed amounts, Licensor may charge interest on overdue amounts at the lesser of one and one‑half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, and may suspend Licensee’s access to paid services after providing notice and an opportunity to cure.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 8.2</strong> — Taxes, duties, and withholding All License Fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, or other governmental charges (collectively, “Taxes”). Licensee shall be responsible for all Taxes arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than taxes based on Licensor’s net income. If Licensee is required by applicable law to withhold any Taxes from payments to Licensor, Licensee shall provide Licensor with official documentation evidencing such withholding and shall pay the grossed‑up amount necessary so that Licensor receives the full amount it would have received absent withholding, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing or unless a valid exemption certificate is provided.

<strong>Clause 8.3</strong> — Audit rights and compliance verification To ensure compliance with the scope of the license grant and payment obligations, Licensor (or an independent third party engaged by Licensor under confidentiality obligations) shall have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice and during normal business hours, to audit Licensee’s records and systems to verify compliance with this Agreement, including the number of installations, users, or instances of the Covered Binaries. Such audits shall occur no more than once per calendar year unless prior audits reveal material non‑compliance. Any audit shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee’s business. If an audit reveals underpayment, Licensee shall promptly pay the shortfall plus interest; if the shortfall exceeds five percent (5%) of amounts due for the audited period, Licensee shall also reimburse Licensor’s reasonable audit costs.

<strong>Clause 8.4</strong> — Refunds, credits, and disputed charges Licensee must notify Licensor in writing of any disputed invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt, specifying the basis for the dispute. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any bona fide disputes. Licensee shall pay all undisputed amounts pending resolution. If Licensor determines that an invoice was issued in error, Licensor shall promptly issue a credit or refund for the erroneous amount. Except as expressly provided herein, Licensee shall not be entitled to set off any amounts owed to Licensor against any claims or alleged damages without Licensor’s prior written consent.

If Licensor receives payment in a currency other than that invoiced, Licensor shall apply the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. Licensor may, in its discretion, require payment in advance for certain License Fees or for Licensees located in jurisdictions with elevated payment risk.

<strong>Clause 9.2</strong> — Licensor indemnity for IP infringement (limited) Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Licensor shall defend Licensee against any claim that the unmodified Covered Binary, as delivered by Licensor and used in accordance with Documentation and this Agreement, infringes a third party’s issued patent, copyright, or registered trademark in the jurisdiction where the claim is asserted, and shall indemnify Licensee for amounts finally awarded by a court or agreed in settlement (provided that Licensor’s settlement does not impose any obligation on Licensee without Licensee’s consent). Licensor’s obligations under this clause are contingent upon Licensee: (a) promptly notifying Licensor in writing of the claim; (b) granting Licensor sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) providing reasonable cooperation and assistance at Licensor’s expense. Licensor shall have no liability for claims arising from modifications made by Licensee, combination with non‑Licensor products, or use in a manner not contemplated by Documentation.

<p>
<strong>Clause 12.1</strong> — Definition of Confidential Information For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means non‑public information disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, non‑public technical information, trade secrets, business plans, pricing, customer lists, source code (where provided under a separate agreement), and any non‑public terms of this Agreement. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than through a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction and without breach of a confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 12.2</strong> — Obligations of confidentiality and limited use The Receiving Party shall: (a) protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care; (b) use the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement; and (c) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except to those of its employees, contractors, or advisors who have a need to know and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those set forth herein. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of confidentiality by its representatives.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 12.3</strong> — Compelled disclosure and protective measures If the Receiving Party is compelled by law, regulation, or valid legal process to disclose Confidential Information, it shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any disclosed information.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 12.4</strong> — Publicity, press releases, and case studies Neither party shall issue any press release, public statement, or marketing communication that references the other party, its name, trademarks, or logos, or the existence or terms of this Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent, except that Licensor may, unless Licensee objects in writing within thirty (30) days of initial deployment, include Licensee’s name in a non‑disparaging customer list or general marketing materials identifying Licensee as a customer. Any permitted use of a party’s trademarks shall be in accordance with that party’s brand guidelines and subject to prior written approval.

<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 13.1</strong> — Allocation of commercial risk and bargained exchange The parties expressly acknowledge that the allocation of risk set forth in this Agreement is a material element of the bargain and that Licensee’s acceptance of the license and related terms is conditioned upon, and in consideration of, Licensor’s ability to limit its exposure to liability. Licensee agrees that, except to the extent that mandatory law provides otherwise, Licensor shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of data, loss of anticipated savings, or costs of procurement of substitute goods or services, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This allocation applies regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and shall survive termination of this Agreement. The parties further agree that the limitations and exclusions set forth herein reflect a reasonable and negotiated apportionment of risk given the nature of the Covered Binaries, the availability of insurance, and the commercial alternatives available to Licensee.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 13.2</strong> — Monetary cap and measurement of damages Subject to any non‑waivable statutory provisions, Licensor’s aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (a) the total License Fees actually paid by Licensee to Licensor for the specific Covered Binary giving rise to the claim during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to liability, or (b) the minimum amount required by mandatory law in the jurisdiction where the claim is adjudicated. Where Licensee has not paid any License Fees for the Covered Binary in question, Licensor’s aggregate liability shall be limited to a nominal sum not to exceed the minimum amount permitted by applicable law. The parties agree that this monetary cap is a fundamental element of the bargain and that, absent such limitation, Licensor would not have made the Covered Binaries available on the terms set forth herein.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 13.3 — Carve‑outs for gross negligence and willful misconduct Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability for (a) death or personal injury caused by Licensor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct to the extent such exclusion is unenforceable under applicable law; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any other liability that cannot be lawfully limited or excluded by contract in the relevant jurisdiction. In the event a court or arbitrator determines that a particular exclusion or limitation is unenforceable, the parties agree that such determination shall be applied only to the narrowest extent necessary and that the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 13.4</strong> — Mitigation obligation and duty to minimize damages Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss, damage, or liability for which it seeks recovery under this Agreement. Licensee shall, where practicable, take reasonable steps to prevent or minimize any loss arising from the use or inability to use the Covered Binaries, including but not limited to maintaining appropriate backups, implementing redundancy, applying security patches, and following the Documentation’s recommended operational practices. Failure by Licensee to take reasonable mitigation steps shall reduce any recoverable damages in proportion to the extent such failure contributed to the loss.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 13.5</strong> — Exclusion of consequential claims from third parties Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor shall have no liability for claims asserted by third parties against Licensee arising from Licensee’s use of the Covered Binaries, including claims by Licensee’s customers, employees, or contractors, except to the extent such claims arise directly from Licensor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Licensee shall indemnify and hold Licensor harmless from and against any third‑party claims that result from Licensee’s misuse, unauthorized distribution, or negligent operation of the Covered Binaries, subject to the indemnification procedures set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 13.6</strong> — Insurance as a complement to contractual limits The parties acknowledge that the allocation of risk in this Agreement contemplates that Licensee will maintain appropriate insurance coverage commensurate with its use of the Covered Binaries. Licensee’s maintenance of insurance shall not limit Licensee’s indemnification obligations but shall be considered by any tribunal as a factor in assessing the reasonableness of the parties’ risk allocation. Licensor may, in its discretion, require evidence of insurance for certain high‑risk deployments or enterprise agreements, and Licensee shall provide such evidence upon reasonable request.

<strong>Clause 14.4</strong> — Self‑certification and periodic reporting In lieu of or in addition to on‑site audits, Licensor may accept periodic self‑certifications from Licensee, executed by an authorized officer, attesting to Licensee’s compliance with the license scope and payment obligations. Licensor may specify the form and frequency of such self‑certifications in writing. Any false or misleading self‑certification shall constitute a material breach and shall entitle Licensor to pursue all available remedies, including audit, injunctive relief, and damages.

<strong>Clause 14.5</strong> — Cooperation with regulatory inquiries and investigations Licensee shall cooperate with Licensor in responding to any bona fide regulatory inquiry, investigation, or subpoena that reasonably relates to the Covered Binaries or to Licensee’s use thereof, provided that Licensor shall reimburse Licensee for reasonable out‑of‑pocket costs incurred in responding to such requests where the inquiry arises from Licensor’s conduct or products. Where legally permissible, the parties shall coordinate responses to regulatory authorities to the extent necessary to protect privileged or confidential information and to ensure consistent factual representations.

<p>
<strong>Clause 14.6</strong> — Remediation plans and corrective actions If an audit, regulatory inquiry, or other credible evidence reveals non‑compliance with this Agreement or applicable law, Licensee shall promptly develop and implement a remediation plan acceptable to Licensor that addresses the root causes and prevents recurrence.

<p>
<strong>Clause 15.2</strong> — Vulnerability disclosure and coordinated remediation If Licensee discovers or reasonably suspects a security vulnerability in a Covered Binary, Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor through the channels specified in Documentation and shall provide sufficient information to allow Licensor to reproduce and assess the issue. Licensor shall acknowledge receipt and shall coordinate with Licensee to develop and, where appropriate, distribute mitigations or patches. The parties agree to follow a coordinated disclosure process that balances the need for timely remediation with the need to avoid public disclosure that could facilitate exploitation, except where disclosure is required by law or by a competent authority.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 15.3</strong> — No first‑party telemetry and optional diagnostic features Licensor reaffirms that the Covered Binaries do not contain first‑party telemetry in their default configurations. Any diagnostic, analytics, or support features that would transmit data to Licensor or its authorized service providers shall be strictly opt‑in and subject to separate, explicit consent. Licensee may enable such optional features for the purpose of receiving enhanced support or diagnostics, but Licensor shall not condition access to critical security updates or essential functionality on Licensee’s consent to such features.

<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 15.4</strong> — Incident response cooperation and notification obligations In the event of a security incident that materially affects the Covered Binaries or Licensee’s systems, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to investigate, contain, and remediate the incident. Each party shall notify the other without undue delay of incidents that materially affect the other party’s systems or data and shall provide reasonable assistance in forensic analysis and remediation. Where applicable law requires notification to data subjects or regulators, the party with primary responsibility for the affected data shall lead such notifications, and the other party shall provide reasonable assistance.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 15.5</strong> — Penetration testing and third‑party assessments Licensee may conduct penetration testing or security assessments of its own deployments of the Covered Binaries provided that such testing is performed in a manner that does not disrupt Licensor’s services, does not attempt to access Licensor’s internal systems, and is conducted in accordance with any testing guidelines published by Licensor. Licensee shall provide Licensor with prior written notice of planned tests and shall coordinate timing to minimize operational impact. Any findings that indicate a vulnerability in the Covered Binaries shall be reported to Licensor promptly and treated in accordance with the vulnerability disclosure process.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 15.6</strong> — Security warranties and limitation of liability for security events Licensor does not warrant that the Covered Binaries are free from vulnerabilities or that they will prevent all security incidents. Licensor’s obligations with respect to security are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate Support Services agreement. Except for liabilities arising from Licensor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, Licensor shall not be liable for security incidents resulting from Licensee’s failure to implement reasonable security measures, failure to apply Updates, or misuse of the Covered Binaries.

<strong>Clause 16.1</strong> — Inventory of third‑party components and transparency Licensor shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, maintain and make available an inventory of third‑party components and Source Components included in the Covered Binaries, together with references to the applicable Source Licenses (e.g., [SOURCE_LICENSE_REFERENCE]) and any obligations that may flow from such licenses. This inventory may be provided in Documentation, a NOTICE file, or a repository referenced by the Covered Binary. Licensee acknowledges that while Licensor will use reasonable efforts to keep such inventory current, the dynamic nature of software supply chains may result in occasional discrepancies, and Licensee should perform its own due diligence where compliance with particular Source Licenses is material to Licensee’s use.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 16.2</strong> — Copyleft and reciprocal obligations; segregation of proprietary code Where a Source License imposes reciprocal obligations (commonly referred to as “copyleft”), such obligations shall apply only to the Source Components governed by that Source License and shall not be interpreted to apply to Licensor’s proprietary components, trade secrets, or other non‑open‑source portions of the Covered Binaries, except to the extent expressly required by the Source License and applicable law. Licensor shall endeavor to architect the Covered Binaries so that proprietary and open‑source components are clearly delineated and so that Licensee’s obligations under copyleft licenses are limited to the components to which they properly apply.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 16.3</strong> — License compatibility and conflict resolution In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Source License that cannot be reconciled by interpretation, the parties agree that the Source License shall govern solely with respect to the Source Components covered thereby, and this Agreement shall govern Licensor’s proprietary components. If a Source License requires distribution of source code or imposes obligations that would, in Licensor’s reasonable judgment, require disclosure of Licensor’s proprietary source code, Licensor may, at its option, (a) provide a commercially reasonable alternative, (b) remove or replace the affected Source Component in a future release, or (c) discontinue distribution of the affected Covered Binary.

<strong>Clause 20.1</strong> — Dual‑license obedience principle Licensee acknowledges and agrees that, where a Covered Binary incorporates or depends upon Source Components governed by one or more Free and Open Source Software licenses (collectively, “FOSS Licenses”), or Ethical-Source licenses, Licensee must comply concurrently with the terms of those FOSS Licenses and with the terms of this Agreement to the extent each applies to the respective subject matter. Compliance with a FOSS License does not, by itself, discharge Licensee’s obligations under this Agreement with respect to Licensor’s proprietary components, and compliance with this Agreement does not, by itself, discharge obligations that arise solely under a FOSS License.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.2</strong> — Scope of FOSS obligations and proprietary carve‑outs Where a FOSS License grants rights with respect to Source Components, those rights shall apply only to the Source Components covered by that FOSS License; Licensor’s proprietary components, trade secrets, and other non‑open‑source elements of the Covered Binaries remain governed exclusively by this Agreement unless Licensor expressly states otherwise in writing. Licensee shall not conflate the rights granted by a FOSS License with rights under this Agreement and shall not assert that compliance with one relieves it of obligations under the other.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.3</strong> — Hierarchy and conflict resolution rule In the event of an actual conflict between a mandatory provision of a FOSS License and a provision of this Agreement that cannot be reconciled by interpretation, the parties agree that the FOSS License shall govern solely with respect to the Source Components to which it applies, and this Agreement shall govern Licensor’s proprietary components. Where a FOSS License requires distribution of source code or imposes obligations that would, in Licensor’s reasonable judgment, require disclosure of Licensor’s proprietary source code, Licensor may, at its option, provide a commercially reasonable alternative, remove or replace the affected Source Component, or discontinue distribution of the affected Covered Binary.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.4</strong> — Attribution, notices, and preservation of license texts Licensee shall preserve and reproduce, in any distribution or redistribution of Source Components as required by the applicable FOSS Licenses, all copyright notices, license texts, attribution statements, and NOTICE files associated with those Source Components. Where this Agreement requires retention of proprietary notices or branding, Licensee shall not remove or alter such notices when complying with FOSS obligations; Licensee shall take reasonable steps to present both sets of notices in a manner that is clear, non‑contradictory, and consistent with the respective licenses.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.5</strong> — Modifications and derivative works involving Source Components If Licensee modifies Source Components governed by a FOSS License, Licensee shall comply with any obligations to make source code available, to provide notices of modification, or to apply reciprocal licensing terms to the modified Source Components, as required by the applicable FOSS License. Any modifications to Licensor’s proprietary components remain subject to the prohibitions on reverse engineering, modification, and derivative works set forth in this Agreement, except to the limited extent that mandatory law or an express written exception permits otherwise.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.6</strong> — Distribution of combined works and separation obligations Where Licensee distributes a combined work that includes both Source Components and Licensor’s proprietary components, Licensee shall structure such distribution in a manner that preserves the separability of the components and that clearly identifies which parts are governed by FOSS Licenses and which parts are governed by this Agreement. Licensee shall not attempt to relicense Licensor’s proprietary components under a FOSS License or to imply that Licensor’s proprietary components are subject to the terms of any FOSS License absent Licensor’s explicit written consent.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.7</strong> — Notice of FOSS obligations and indemnity cooperation Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor if it becomes aware of any claim, obligation, or requirement arising under a FOSS License that could materially affect Licensor’s rights or the distribution of the Covered Binaries. Licensee shall cooperate reasonably with Licensor in defending or resolving such claims, including by providing factual information and by implementing remediation measures where appropriate. Licensee’s failure to comply with FOSS obligations that results in liability to Licensor shall be treated as a material breach and shall trigger Licensee’s indemnity obligations.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.8</strong> — Audit and verification of FOSS compliance Licensor reserves the right to audit Licensee’s compliance with FOSS obligations insofar as such compliance affects Licensor’s proprietary interests or distribution rights, subject to the audit procedures and confidentiality protections set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. Audits shall be conducted on reasonable notice and during normal business hours and shall be limited in scope to the aspects of Licensee’s use and distribution that implicate FOSS compliance.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.9</strong> — Preservation of FOSS license freedoms where required To the extent a FOSS License grants Licensee freedoms (such as the right to copy, modify, or redistribute Source Components), nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to restrict or curtail those freedoms with respect to the Source Components themselves; however, such freedoms do not extend to Licensor’s proprietary components, and Licensee shall not use FOSS freedoms as a basis to claim rights in Licensor’s proprietary code.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.10</strong> — Representations and warranties regarding contributed Source Components If Licensee contributes Source Components, patches, or other materials to Licensor’s projects, Licensee represents and warrants that it has the right to contribute such materials under the applicable FOSS License and that doing so will not impose obligations on Licensor’s proprietary components beyond those Licensor has expressly accepted. Licensee shall indemnify Licensor for any claims arising from misrepresentations in this regard.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.11</strong> — Documentation and user guidance for mixed‑license distributions Where Licensor provides Documentation or distribution artifacts that include both Source Components and proprietary components, Licensor will, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide guidance identifying applicable FOSS Licenses and any obligations that may flow to downstream recipients. Such guidance is informational and does not substitute for Licensee’s independent legal obligations to comply with FOSS Licenses.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 20.12</strong> — Survival and severability of coexistence obligations The obligations set forth in this Axiom 20 regarding coexistence, notice, audit, and indemnity with respect to FOSS Licenses shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement to the extent necessary to give effect to any continuing obligations under applicable FOSS Licenses or to permit Licensor to enforce its proprietary rights and remedies.

<h4>
Axiom 30 (not-binding) - MitsuoLabs™ DECLARATION OF MODERN DAYS — V1 (2026)
</h4>
<p>
This is THE document, not a document — a living covenant, an operational manifesto, and a public promise. It names what others hedge around, names what others fear to say, and binds our engineering, governance, and public life to uncompromising standards. It is written to be read.
</p>
<p>
Note: This is not part of any binding contract, and is not enforceable, but it shows our aspirations and desires for the future of the humanity.
</p>
<p>
Preamble: We live at a moment when small design choices scale to planetary effects. The code we ship, the models we train, and the markets we enter shape ecosystems, livelihoods, civic discourse, and the moral imagination of generations. MitsuoLabs™ declares that invention without stewardship is negligence. We commit to building technologies that protect dignity, restore ecosystems, defend creators, and expand human flourishing. We will be candid where others equivocate, courageous where others capitulate, and accountable where others hide.
</p>
<p>
Anthem 🔐🔥 At MitsuoLabs™ we Believe in a Privacy‑First Future and in the Ethical‑Source Revival. This anthem guides our priorities: privacy as default, openness as foundation, and responsibility as practice.
</p>
<p>
Below are the 35 core commitments that define MitsuoLabs™’ posture, priorities, and operational aspirations.
</p>
<p>
1. Stewardship of Life. Design decisions should account for ecological limits. Regeneration, not extraction, is our baseline. Product lifecycles should include restoration budgets and measurable ecological KPIs.
</p>
<p>
2. Privacy First Architecture. Privacy is a structural constraint. Default to local processing, data minimization, strong cryptography, and user control over provenance and deletion.
</p>
<p>
3. FOSS Revival. We should commit to open foundations: publish core tooling, contribute upstream, fund maintainers, and defend provenance and attribution for creators.
</p>
<p>
4. Human Work and LLM Transition. LLMs accelerate change. We should prioritize augmentation, require human oversight for consequential outputs, fund retraining programs, and pilot portable benefits and wage‑insurance schemes.
</p>
<p>
5. Against Nihilism. We should reject nihilism. Systems that hollow out meaning, community, or moral responsibility will be redesigned or retired; product metrics include measures of social meaning and civic health.
</p>
<p>
6. Copycats Are Harmful. Predatory imitation that strips context, erodes craft, or weaponizes others’ labor is unacceptable. We should enforce provenance, support creators legally and technically, and refuse to reward parasitic cloning.
</p>
<p>
7. Dignity of Labor. Work is human dignity. Automation must expand opportunity; MitsuoLabs™ should funds transitions, supports living standards where our systems create value, and designs pathways to higher‑value roles.
</p>
<p>
8. Safety and Duty to Repair. We should accept moral responsibility for harms. Preserve evidence, report transparently, remediate swiftly, and compensate where appropriate. Concealment should be a breach.
</p>
<p>
9. Transparency and Auditability. Opacity is a governance failure. Systems that materially affect people should be auditable, explainable, and contestable; provenance metadata should be mandatory.
</p>
<p>
10. Non‑Discrimination and Anti‑Persecution. We should not enable persecution or institutionalized discrimination. We should act decisively against tools or deployments that amplify hate, even when politically convenient.
</p>
<p>
11. Protection of Religious Communities. Conscience and worship should be protected. We should not tolerate campaigns or tools that persecute Christians, Jews, or any faith community.
</p>
<p>
12. Institutional Courage and Whistleblower Protection. We should name failures and fix them. Whistleblowers should be protected; independent oversight should be funded and empowered to act.
</p>
<p>
13. Cosmic Humility and Long Horizons. Design with the cosmos in mind. Planetary stewardship and intergenerational duty should shape architectures and choices; precaution guides planetary‑scale interventions.
</p>
<p>
14. Education and Civic Formation. Democracy requires literate citizens. We should invest in civic, digital, and scientific literacy so people can contest and shape systems that shape them.
</p>
<p>
15. Art Beauty and Moral Imagination. Aesthetic choices are moral choices. Interfaces and artifacts should invite reflection, not addiction; artists and humanists should participate in design reviews.
</p>
<p>
16. Commons and Shared Infrastructure. Commons must be governed, not pillaged. Data commons, seed banks, and public code should require democratic stewardship and enforceable protections.
</p>
<p>
17. Anti‑Exploitation of the Vulnerable. We should not design for exploitation. Systems that prey on cognitive vulnerabilities, target children, or monetize harm should be banned from our stacks.
</p>
<p>
18. Responsible Research and Publication. Curiosity should be bounded by care. High‑risk research should require authorization, oversight, and mitigation; we should not publish work that materially increases large‑scale risks without governance.
</p>
<p>
19. Anti‑Weaponization and Non‑Complicity. We should refuse to be a tool for violence. We should not enable weaponization, repression, or automated coercion; we should withdraw support from actors who misuse our work.
</p>
<p>
20. Economic Justice and Shared Benefit Models. Value should be shared. We should pilot cooperative ownership, data trusts, revenue‑sharing, and licensing models that return value to contributors and communities.
</p>
<p>
21. Governance by Design. Power without checks is a hazard. Procurement, deployment, and updates should embed contestability, appeal, and independent review; contracts should carry enforceable remediation clauses.
</p>
<p>
22. Privacy and Security as Civic Infrastructure. Security and privacy should be public goods. We should fund public forensic capacity, coordinated disclosure, and accessible incident reporting; we should publish redacted transparency reports.
</p>
<p>
23. Interoperability and Responsible Competition. Competition must be responsible. We should interoperate where it benefits users, refuse anti‑competitive lock‑in, and oppose predatory practices that harm ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
24. Cultural Memory and Sacred Spaces. We should protect cultural and sacred heritage. Places of worship, memory, and cultural practice are not data points to be monetized or weaponized.
</p>
<p>
25. Climate and Planetary Responsibility. Climate is a design constraint. We should measure and minimize lifecycle emissions, prioritize low‑impact architectures, and fund carbon‑removal and restoration projects.
</p>
<p>
26. Children and Future Generations. Protect the young and the unborn. Systems should include special safeguards for minors and obligations to future persons; design reviews should include child‑safety audits.
</p>
<p>
27. Scientific Integrity and Reproducibility. Science must be trustworthy. We should commit to reproducible research, open methods, and public accountability for claims that affect public policy.
</p>
<p>
28. Accessibility and Inclusion. Design for all bodies and minds. Accessibility should be a baseline; inclusion should be a design imperative; audits and remediation should be routine.
</p>
<p>
29. Mental Health and Social Meaning. Technology shapes inner life. We should design to preserve social bonds, support mental health, and avoid architectures that amplify despair or isolation.
</p>
<p>
30. Global Solidarity and Equitable Access. Benefits must cross borders. We should support capacity building, affordable access, and open research in lower‑resource contexts; licensing and pricing should reflect equity.
</p>
<p>
31. Against Hypocrisy. We will not tolerate hypocrisy, especially our own. We should commit to radical self-scrutiny and public accountability. When our actions diverge from our stated values, we should acknowledge the failure, remediate the harm, and correct our course without excuse.
</p>
<p>
32. The Duty to Act (Against Omission). We should reject the sin of omission. Knowing of a harm and failing to act is complicity. We should commit to intervening where we have the capacity and responsibility to do so, and to speaking out against injustice, even when it is inconvenient or unprofitable. Silence is not neutrality; it is a choice.
</p>
<p>
33. Against Selfishness. We should renounce the creed of unexamined self-interest. Where our own commercial or strategic goals conflict with the health of the commons, the dignity of our partners, or the well-being of our users, we should commit to prioritizing the latter. This is not charity; it is the architecture of a sustainable and just ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
34. Against Modern Slavery. We should declare zero tolerance for all forms of modern slavery. This includes forced labor, debt bondage, human trafficking, and exploitative labor practices within our supply chains and user ecosystems. We should commit to proactive audits, transparent reporting, and immediate severance of ties with any partner or entity found to be complicit in the commodification of human lives.
</p>
<p>
35. Against Digital Tyranny. We should oppose all forms of unaccountable power, whether wielded by states or by corporate sovereigns. We reject architectures of control that create digital serfdom, lock-in, and extractive ecosystems. We should commit to building and supporting decentralized, interoperable, and user-sovereign alternatives that defend against dictatorship in all its forms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A Note on Tone and Courage:</strong> We speak plainly because ambiguity is a refuge for harm. We will be firm where others hedge, compassionate where others punish, and relentless where others are complacent. This Declaration is unapologetic in naming harms and assigning responsibility. We will say <strong>what others fear to say because silence is complicity.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Conclusion: MitsuoLabs™ is more than a company; it is a moral project. This Declaration of Modern Days — V1 (2026) — is a living covenant: to tend trees and code alike, to map galaxies and map harms, to imagine multiverses and ensure that in every possible world human dignity endures. We will be builders who repair, inventors who listen, and citizens who refuse to trade justice for convenience. We will protect privacy, revive open source, defend creators, and refuse nihilism.
</p>
<p>
We <strong>do not</strong> promise perfection. We promise posture and practice: fierce stewardship, radical responsibility, and the courage to say what others fear to say. "A Licensor who adopts this Covenant builds with this posture. A partner who accepts this Covenant accepts that some markets will not be entered, some customers will not be served, and some shortcuts will not be taken."

<h3>
AXIOM 31 (binding) — EXTRAORDINARY SCENARIOS, COSMIC EVENTS, TEMPORAL ANOMALIES, AND FAITH‑BASED SUPPORT
Purpose and scope This Axiom establishes binding obligations, operational protocols, and remedial rights that apply when [[licensor-name]], Licensee, or any party acting under this Agreement encounters extraordinary, low‑probability/high‑impact events or claims that exceed ordinary risk models. Covered scenarios include, without limitation: claims of supernatural or prophetic manifestations; contact with extraterrestrial or other nonhuman intelligences; timeline, temporal, or multiverse anomalies; demonstrable cognitive acceptance or participation by nonhuman organisms or agents; nuclear hostilities or credible existential escalation; and other systemic discontinuities that materially affect safety, rights, continuity, or public order. 
This Axiom also governs [[licensor-name]]‑facilitated faith‑based support, resource assistance to religious communities, and any activities that touch on belief, worship, or conscience. The Axiom applies to all Covered Binaries, Services, Hosted Systems, and activities governed by this Agreement.
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
31.1 — Governing principles. All actions under this Axiom shall be guided by the following non‑derogable principles: (a) protection of human life and bodily integrity; (b) respect for freedom of conscience, belief, and worship; (c) prohibition of coercion in matters of belief or worship; (d) preservation of evidence, provenance, and chain of custody; (e) transparency, proportionality, and accountability in emergency measures; and (f) non‑discrimination and protection of vulnerable populations.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.2 — High evidentiary threshold and verification. No extraordinary operational, legal, or public‑facing action shall be taken on the basis of extraordinary claims absent a documented, multi‑modal verification process. Verification must include authenticated telemetry or artifacts where available, independent expert review, reproducible observations where feasible, and a documented chain of custody. Single‑source, anecdotal, or uncorroborated assertions do not satisfy the verification threshold.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.3 — Preservation and immutable logging. Upon detection of an extraordinary event or credible claim thereof, the responsible party shall immediately preserve all relevant artifacts, telemetry, state snapshots, and decision logs in tamper‑evident, authenticated form. Preservation obligations survive termination of this Agreement to the extent necessary for lawful investigations and remediation.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.4 — Safe‑mode, suspension, and freeze authority [[licensor-name]] reserves the right to place Covered Systems into predefined safe modes, suspend nonessential services, freeze automated deployments, and halt state‑mutating processes when an extraordinary scenario threatens public safety, data integrity, or evidentiary preservation. Such measures shall be proportionate, time‑limited, documented, and accompanied by criteria for de‑escalation and review.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.5 — Religious or prophetic phenomena — neutrality, pastoral support, and resource assistance. If an event is interpreted by any community as religiously significant, [[licensor-name]] and Licensee shall treat the phenomenon as a social and public‑order matter requiring pastoral sensitivity and public‑safety coordination. The [[licensor-name]] may provide transparent, voluntary, and documented faith‑based support and resource assistance to religious communities (including counseling, logistical aid, shelter, communications support, and material relief) provided that such assistance is: (a) clearly labeled and opt‑in; (b) segregated from operational decision‑making and procurement; (c) provided with informed consent and privacy safeguards; (d) non‑coercive and non‑conditional on commercial or legal concessions; and (e) subject to independent oversight and public accounting as described in Clause 31.21.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.6 — Permissible faith‑based outreach and transparency requirements. [[licensor-name]] may support faith‑based outreach or community resilience programs where lawful and where participation is voluntary and transparent. All [[licensor-name]]‑facilitated religious outreach must be: (a) explicitly disclosed to affected users and communities; (b) opt‑in with documented consent; (c) accompanied by clear privacy and data‑use notices; and (d) subject to audit and public reporting. The [[licensor-name]] shall not use operational systems, recommendation engines, or covert targeting to promote faith‑based outreach.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.7 — Prohibition on covert, deceptive, or coercive proselytizing. No employee, contractor, partner, or Licensee shall engage in covert, deceptive, or surreptitious proselytizing using [[licenso-name]] systems, data, or services. Covert proselytizing includes any attempt to influence belief, worship, or religious affiliation through hidden messaging, undisclosed targeting, manipulation of content or recommendation systems, or exploitation of trust without explicit, informed consent. Any such conduct is a material breach of this Agreement and subject to immediate remedial and disciplinary measures.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.8 — Permitted resource support with safeguards. [[licensor-name]] may provide material or logistical support to religious organizations (including emergency relief, shelter, communications infrastructure, and legal aid) where: (a) the support is documented in a written agreement that specifies scope, duration, and non‑commercial terms; (b) recipients demonstrate lawful status and community accountability; (c) support is provided equitably and without discrimination among faith communities; and (d) the [[licensor-name]] publishes an annual transparency report listing resource allocations, redacted as necessary for privacy and safety.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.9 — Equal treatment and non‑discrimination in faith support. Resource support or faith‑based services provided by [[licensor-name]] shall be administered on a non‑discriminatory basis. The [[licensor-name]] shall not favor, prioritize, or condition assistance on political alignment, commercial relationships, or doctrinal conformity. Where limited resources require prioritization, the [[licensor-name]] shall apply neutral, documented humanitarian criteria (e.g., vulnerability, displacement, immediate safety needs).
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.10 — Contact with extraterrestrial or nonhuman intelligences — coordination and scientific rigor. Contact protocols prioritize safety, non‑escalation, scientific rigor, and international coordination. [[licensor-name]] will: (a) preserve and authenticate all data and artifacts; (b) defer diplomatic and policy responses to competent national and international authorities; (c) provide technical assistance only under lawful authorization; and (d) ensure that any shared data or artifacts are transmitted to accredited scientific bodies and lawful investigative authorities.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.11 — Timeline, temporal, and multiverse anomalies — state integrity and non‑exploitation. Apparent temporal anomalies, state inconsistencies, or claims of alternate timelines trigger immediate preservation of system state, immutable logging, and suspension of automated actions that could propagate inconsistent or irreconcilable states. Licensee shall not exploit temporal anomalies for competitive advantage. Any corrective or experimental action that could alter system state or legal relations requires documented multi‑disciplinary approval, legal counsel, and independent oversight.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.12 — Nonhuman cognitive acceptance and species‑appropriate safeguards. Where nonhuman organisms or intelligences demonstrate capacities to accept, assent, or participate in human social constructs, the parties shall apply a precautionary ethic: (a) human communities retain primacy in decisions affecting human rights; (b) any recognition of nonhuman assent requires independent ethical review and species‑appropriate communication protocols; (c) no binding legal status or contractual obligation shall be attributed to nonhuman agents absent express statutory authorization; and (d) engagements with nonhuman agents must avoid exploitation and prioritize welfare.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.13 — Low‑cognition or nonstandard agents — guardianship and oversight. Interactions with low‑IQ or nonstandard agents (including nonhuman animals, emergent simple agents, or constrained synthetic entities) are governed by welfare, non‑exploitation, and scientific ethics. Such agents shall not be treated as legal proxies for human consent; human guardianship, institutional oversight, and documented ethical approval are required for any engagement with legal or material effect.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.14 — Nuclear conflict and existential escalation — continuity and non‑escalation. In the event of nuclear hostilities, credible threats of mass destruction, or other existential escalations, [[licensor-name]] will prioritize continuity of life‑critical systems, preservation of human life, and cooperation with civil defense and humanitarian authorities. The [[licensor-name]] will not take actions that materially increase escalation risk, facilitate unlawful targeting, or otherwise contribute to harm.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.15 — Public communication, rumor control, and misinformation mitigation. Public communications shall be coordinated with competent authorities and accredited scientific bodies to reduce panic and misinformation. Communications must be factual, transparent about uncertainty, and limited to verified information. The [[licensor-name]] will not disseminate speculative claims or unverified narratives and will actively correct demonstrable misinformation arising from [[licensor-name]] systems.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.16 — Emergency ethics review and multi‑stakeholder oversight. Extraordinary scenarios trigger an emergency ethics review that includes independent scientists, ethicists, legal counsel, civil society representatives, and, where appropriate, cultural or religious leaders. Material decisions require documented multi‑stakeholder concurrence where feasible; unilateral emergency actions are limited to narrowly defined safety measures and must be reported and reviewed promptly.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.17 — Non‑discrimination and protection of minorities during crises. Emergency measures must not be applied discriminatorily. [[licensor-name]] will guard against scapegoating, persecution, or disproportionate burdens on vulnerable groups and will implement targeted protections where risks are asymmetric.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.18 — Limits on unilateral legal or status changes. No employee, contractor, or Licensee may unilaterally alter the legal status, rights, or identity of persons or entities in response to extraordinary claims. Any proposal to change legal status, recognition, or rights requires lawful process and documented authorization from competent authorities.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.19 — International law, treaties, and cross‑border coordination. Responses that implicate cross‑border effects shall comply with international law, treaty obligations, export controls, and coordinated protocols. [[licensor-name]] will cooperate with international scientific and diplomatic bodies and will not act in ways that contravene binding international obligations.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.20 — Remediation, restitution, and community engagement. Where [[licensor-name]] actions during extraordinary scenarios cause harm, [[licensor-name]] will implement remediation and restitution in consultation with affected communities and independent oversight. Remediation may include compensation, public accounting, restoration measures, and policy reform.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.21 — Transparency reporting for faith and extraordinary support. [[licensor-name]] will publish an annual, redacted transparency report that discloses aggregate resource support to faith communities, emergency pastoral assistance provided, and remediation actions taken under this Axiom. Reports will redact personal data and sensitive security details but will include sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance and equitable treatment.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.22 — Funding, grants, and third‑party partnerships for faith support. When providing grants, in‑kind aid, or partnerships with faith organizations, [[licensor-name]] will use written agreements that specify scope, non‑commercial terms, accountability measures, and audit rights. Third‑party partners receiving [[licensor-name]] funds must agree to non‑discrimination, privacy, and anti‑coercion covenants.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.23 — Interfaith advisory council and cultural liaison network. [[licensor-name]] will maintain an Interfaith Advisory Council and a Cultural Liaison Network to advise on culturally informed responses (it's a wish, not a warrant), to vet proposed faith‑based assistance, and to reduce the risk of harm from misinterpretation. Council membership will be diverse, rotating, and include independent civil‑society representation.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.24 — Data protection and privacy for faith interactions. Data collected in the course of faith‑based support or extraordinary‑event response (including counseling records, shelter manifests, and consent forms) shall be treated as sensitive personal data. The [[licensor-name]] will apply the highest applicable privacy standards, limit retention, and require explicit consent for any secondary use.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.25 — Limits on political proselytizing and partisan use [[licensor-name]]‑facilitated faith support must not be used for partisan political ends. [[licensor-name]] will prohibit the use of [[licensor-name]] resources to influence electoral outcomes, to recruit for political movements, or to condition assistance on political support.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.26 — Cultural heritage protection and sacred sites. [[licensor-name]] will not permit the exploitation, commercialization, or desecration of cultural heritage or sacred sites in the course of extraordinary‑event response or product deployment. Where [[licensor-name]] operations affect cultural heritage, the [[licensor-name]] will consult recognized cultural authorities and fund protective measures.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.27 — Research ethics, controlled disclosure, and publication controls for extraordinary findings Research that could materially affect public safety, social order, or international stability requires pre‑publication review and, where necessary, controlled disclosure. The [[licensor-name]] may withhold or delay publication of sensitive findings pending mitigation, lawful authorization, and ethical safeguards.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.28 — Training, drills, and preparedness research. [[licensor-name]] will maintain scenario planning, simulations, and tabletop exercises for a range of extraordinary events, including nuclear contingency, mass contact, temporal anomalies, and faith‑based mass mobilizations. Training will include cultural competence, pastoral sensitivity, and misinformation mitigation.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.29 — Community restitution fund. [[licensor-name]] will maintain a Community Restitution Fund to provide rapid financial assistance, legal aid, and restoration resources to communities harmed by [[licensor-name]] actions during extraordinary scenarios (the size of the fund depends on a lot of variables, so it's not a warranty, but a wish). Disbursements will be governed by transparent criteria and independent oversight.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.30 — Ethical use of faith‑adjacent data for product development. Any use of aggregated, de‑identified data derived from faith‑based support activities for product improvement or research requires prior ethical review, documented community consent, and an opt‑out mechanism for affected communities.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.31 — Sunset, review, and democratic oversight of emergency powers. Emergency measures are temporary and must include explicit sunset clauses, periodic review, and criteria for de‑escalation. Extraordinary authorities expire automatically unless renewed through documented, multi‑stakeholder processes and lawful authorization.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.32 — Auditability, transparency, and public reporting. All extraordinary‑scenario responses and faith‑support programs are subject to independent audit. [[licensor-name]] will publish redacted summaries of actions taken, findings, and remediation steps, except where disclosure would materially endanger safety or lawful investigations. Violations of this Axiom by personnel or partners trigger disciplinary action, contractual remedies, and public disclosure where appropriate.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
31.33 — Indemnity, liability, and good‑faith protection Licensee acknowledges that extraordinary scenarios may impose costs and risks beyond ordinary operations. Where [[licensor-name]] acts in good faith and in compliance with this Axiom, the [[licensor-name]]’s liability shall be governed by the indemnity and limitation provisions of this Agreement; bad‑faith actions, willful concealment, covert proselytizing, or gross negligence remain fully actionable.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>
AXIOM 32 — EXTRA PROTECTION CLAUSES Purpose and scope This Axiom 32 sets forth thirty‑two additional, affirmative protections that supplement the Agreement’s core obligations.

<h3>
AXIOM 33 — USER CAPACITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Purpose and scope: This Axiom 33 clarifies the user’s absolute and non-transferable responsibility for their own state of mind, capacity, and judgment when using [[licensor-name]]’s software, particularly for high-risk or safety-critical actions. Its purpose is to ensure that Licensee explicitly acknowledges and assumes the risks associated with using powerful tools while their own decision-making capacity may be compromised.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
33.1. User’s Warranty of Capacity. By using the software, and most especially when executing any high-risk, irreversible, or financially significant action, Licensee represents and warrants that they possess the necessary mental capacity, sobriety, and soundness of judgment to understand the action and its consequences. Licensee acknowledges they are solely responsible for this self-assessment.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
33.2. Assumption of Risk for Impaired Use. Licensee expressly agrees that if they choose to operate the software while their capacity is diminished for any reason—including but not limited to intoxication, influence of prescribed or illicit substances, emotional distress, or fatigue—they do so at their own sole peril. Licensee knowingly and voluntarily assumes all risks and liabilities for any and all outcomes arising from such use, and waives any right to claim lack of capacity as a defense against the consequences of their actions.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
33.3. Reliance on Outputs. Any output, analysis, or recommendation generated by the software is not a substitute for professional human judgment. Reliance on such outputs as a basis for legal, medical, financial, or safety-critical decisions without independent human verification is a misuse of the software. This is doubly true if the user’s capacity is compromised; in such cases, failure to seek independent, unimpaired professional advice constitutes gross negligence on the part of the Licensee.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
33.4. Affirmation and High-Risk Gateways. Where appropriate, [[licensor-name]] may implement user interface gateways (e.g., confirmation dialogues, timed delays, or challenge-response tests) before executing high-risk actions. Licensee agrees that completing such a gateway constitutes a separate, explicit, and legally binding affirmation at that moment in time that they are of sound mind and accept full responsibility for the impending action.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
33.5. Special Duty for Medically Impaired Users. If a Licensee knows they are using lawful, prescribed medication that may alter their judgment or cognition, they have a heightened, non-delegable duty of care. By using the software, they affirm that they have consulted with a qualified human professional about the risks and have established their own safeguards (such as requiring a second, unimpaired individual to review their actions) before relying on the software for any consequential task. They explicitly waive any right to claim that their medically-induced impairment nullifies their responsibility, as this Axiom required them to anticipate and mitigate that specific risk.

33.6. Indemnification for Impaired Use. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [[licensor-name]] from any and all claims, damages, or liabilities arising from Licensee’s use of the software while their capacity was, or was alleged to be, impaired.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
33.7. Legal Age and Incapacity. User affirmates, under the risk of perjury, they have the legal age of consent (parental consent is allowed, in this case the parent/legal responsible are the legal responsibles from all the minor/legal incapable, and affirm it'll be solely for Professional-use (b2b, and not consumer-bussiness))

<h3>
AXIOM 34 — LAYERED DEFENSE AND CONSUMER FALLBACK PROTOCOL.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Purpose and scope: This Axiom establishes a layered defense against the risks of jurisdictional recharacterization of this professional, B2B Agreement as a consumer contract. It imposes a duty of candor on the Licensee, defines the consequences of misrepresentation, and establishes a pre-negotiated, contingent set of fallback terms (the “Consumer Fallback Protocol”) that activate only if a competent authority compels a consumer characterization, thereby ensuring maximum contractual continuity.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.1</strong> — Second Affirmation and Warranty of Professional Use. By accepting this Agreement, Licensee once again, separately and explicitly, represents and warrants that it is a sophisticated commercial, academic, governmental, or professional entity, and that the Covered Binaries are being licensed solely for professional or organizational purposes, not for personal, family, or household use. Licensee acknowledges that the Licensor has relied on this representation as a material inducement to enter into this Agreement on the terms set forth herein.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.2</strong> — Affirmative Duty to Disclose Consumer Status. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee reasonably believes it qualifies as a “consumer” with non-waivable rights under the mandatory laws of its jurisdiction, Licensee has an affirmative, pre-contractual duty to declare this status to Licensor by the mechanism provided in Appendix 17 or, failing that, by written notice to [[licensor-name]] before accepting this Agreement. Failure to provide such notice is a waiver of any subsequent claim to consumer status to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.3</strong> — Consequence of Non-Disclosure: Estoppel and Misrepresentation Licensee’s failure to declare its consumer status as required by Clause 34.2 shall be deemed a deliberate and material misrepresentation. In any subsequent dispute, Licensor shall be entitled to argue that Licensee is legally and equitably estopped from asserting consumer status, and Licensee agrees that its silence shall be presented as conclusive evidence of its original professional-use intent.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.4</strong> — Licensor’s Unilateral Right of Termination. Upon Discovery If Licensor discovers, through its own diligence or by notice from Licensee, that Licensee is or has become a consumer who failed to make the required declaration, Licensor may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement and all licenses granted hereunder immediately upon written notice, without penalty or further obligation.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.5</strong> — Triggering of the Consumer Fallback Protocol. The terms set forth in Clauses 34.6 through 34.10 shall apply only if, and to the extent that, a court or arbitral tribunal of final, competent jurisdiction expressly rejects the Licensee’s professional-use warranties and declares this Agreement to be a consumer contract subject to non-waivable consumer protection laws. This protocol does not activate by mere allegation, but only by binding legal order.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.6</strong> — Fallback License (Consumer). Upon activation of the Fallback Protocol, the license grant in Axiom 3 is modified to be a non-exclusive, revocable license for personal, non-commercial use on a single device controlled by the Licensee for the duration of any subscription term, or for a period of one (1) year for a perpetual license, subject to renewal.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.7</strong> — Fallback Limitation of Liability (Consumer). Upon activation, the monetary cap in Axiom 13.2 is replaced with the following: Licensor’s aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of (a) the total license fees actually paid by the Licensee in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100.00) or the minimum amount permitted under the applicable mandatory consumer law. Liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct remains as provided in Clause 13.3.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.8</strong> — Fallback Warranty (Consumer). Upon activation, the “AS IS” disclaimer in Axiom 6.2 is modified. Licensor warrants that the Covered Binary will perform substantially in accordance with its Documentation for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of initial installation. Licensor’s sole obligation for breach of this warranty shall be, at its option, to (a) provide a patch or update, or (b) terminate the license and refund the fees paid.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.9</strong> — Fallback Dispute Resolution (Consumer). Upon activation, if the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions of Axiom 18 are held unenforceable, any dispute shall be resolved in a small claims court or court of competent jurisdiction in the Licensee’s domicile. The waiver of class-action proceedings shall remain in effect if it is severable from the arbitration clause under applicable law.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.10</strong> — Inapplicability of Onerous B2B Clauses. Upon activation, the following obligations of Licensee shall be void: the broad indemnity obligations in Axiom 9.1 (replaced by an obligation to indemnify only for willful misuse or breach), the audit rights in Axiom 8.3, and any fee-shifting provisions.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.11</strong> — Protocol as Contingent Remedy, Not Concession. The existence of this Consumer Fallback Protocol is not a concession that any consumer relationship exists. It is a contingent set of terms agreed by the parties in advance to govern the specific and unlikely event that a tribunal compels such a characterization, thereby preserving the enforceability of the Agreement to the maximum possible extent.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 34.12</strong> — Survival and Primacy. This Axiom and the associated Appendix 17 shall survive termination of the Agreement and shall be paramount in any dispute concerning the Licensee’s consumer or professional status.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>
AXIOM 35 — CONTRACTUAL ENFORCEABILITY AND DEFENSE AGAINST UNCONSCIONABILITY.
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Purpose and Scope: This Axiom establishes the contractually agreed-upon rules of interpretation and remedial protocols designed to ensure the maximum enforceability of this Agreement in the face of judicial or arbitral challenges, particularly those based on allegations of unconscionability, vagueness, or violation of public policy. The Licensee explicitly agrees that these rules are a material and bargained-for component of the Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.1</strong> — Acknowledgment of Commercial Reality and Choice: Licensee expressly acknowledges that: (a) it is a sophisticated party entering into a professional, B2B agreement; (b) it has had a meaningful and ample opportunity (via the Acceptance Protocol) to review this Agreement and to seek independent legal counsel; and (c) it is aware of commercial alternatives in the marketplace and has freely chosen to enter into this Agreement. These acknowledgments are intended to estop any subsequent claims of being an unsophisticated party or having no meaningful choice.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.2</strong> — Axiomatic Severability and Mandatory Substitution: If any axiom, clause, or provision is held by a competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable, that authority shall not strike the provision outright. Instead, it must follow this two-step, mandatory protocol: (a) Step One (Reformation): The authority must first attempt to reform or modify the provision to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable while preserving its original economic and risk-allocation intent. (b) Step Two (Substitution): If and only if reformation is impossible, the authority must substitute the invalid provision with its contractually pre-agreed "Universal Fallback Clause" as set forth in Appendix 18. A provision may be severed entirely only if no applicable Fallback Clause exists.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.3</strong> — Economic Rebalancing for Material Invalidation: If a court or arbitrator invalidates a "Material" provision (as designated in Appendix 18) and fails to substitute its corresponding Fallback Clause, this creates a fundamental imbalance in the agreed-upon exchange. Licensor shall then have the unilateral right, upon written notice, to either: (a) terminate the Agreement and provide a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees, or (b) retroactively and prospectively adjust the license fees upward by a commercially reasonable amount to compensate for the unallocated risk newly imposed upon Licensor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.4</strong> — Fee-Shifting for Unsuccessful Foundational Challenges: Should Licensee initiate a legal proceeding challenging the enforceability of any "Material" provision of this Agreement (including but not limited to the Limitation of Liability, Warranty Disclaimer, or Arbitration Clause) and fail to obtain a final judgment invalidating said provision, Licensee shall be liable for and shall pay all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Licensor in defending against that specific challenge.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.5</strong> — Unconscionability as a Defensive Shield Only: Licensee agrees that the legal doctrine of unconscionability (whether procedural or substantive) may only be raised as an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought by Licensor. It cannot be used as the basis for an independent, affirmative cause of action seeking damages or other relief against Licensor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.6</strong> — Strict "As Applied" Standard for Policy Challenges: Licensee agrees that any challenge to the enforceability of the ethical or conduct clauses (e.g., Axioms 19, 26) on the grounds of vagueness or public policy must be brought on an "as applied" basis. This means Licensee may only challenge a clause's application to its own specific, concrete conduct. "Facial" challenges, which argue a clause is inherently invalid in all circumstances, are expressly waived.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.7</strong> — Interpretive Rule of Narrow Construction: In adjudicating a challenge to the ethical or conduct clauses, any ambiguity shall be resolved by adopting the most narrow and specific interpretation that is lawful and enforceable. Broad, political, or subjective interpretations are disfavored. For example, a prohibition on "extremist ideology" shall be construed to apply only to conduct that incites imminent lawless action, not to the abstract expression of unpopular views.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.8</strong> — Distinction Between Core Illegality and Severable Covenants: The prohibitions on per se illegal acts (e.g., CSAM, terrorism, fraud under Axiom 25) are fundamental and non-severable. The behavioral and ethical covenants (e.g., Axiom 26) are severable. A finding that a covenant in Axiom 26 is unenforceable shall not affect the validity of Axiom 25 or the remainder of the Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.9</strong> — Documentation of Negotiation: The parties agree that these terms are deemed to be the result of a negotiated process. The use of a click-wrap format is for efficiency only. Licensee acknowledges it had the right to contact Licensor to negotiate a custom enterprise agreement with different terms, and its decision to accept this standard Agreement was a free commercial choice.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.10</strong> — Neutral Application Covenant by Licensor: Licensor covenants that its enforcement of the Acceptable Use Policy, particularly the politically sensitive clauses of Axiom 26, will be based on objective conduct and applied without regard to the political or ideological viewpoint of the Licensee. A claim of discriminatory enforcement by Licensee must be proven with clear and convincing evidence.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.11</strong> — Safe Harbor for Lawful Expression: For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the ethical or conduct axioms shall be interpreted to prohibit lawful, non-harassing expression of political, religious, or philosophical views that are protected under the applicable governing law.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.12</strong> — Presumption of Validity and Burden of Proof: All terms of this Agreement are contractually presumed to be valid, reasonable, and enforceable. The burden of proving that any term is invalid or unenforceable shall be on the party making the assertion, and the standard of proof shall be "clear and convincing evidence."
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.13</strong> — Waiver of Punitive Damages for Enforcement Disputes: To the fullest extent permitted by law, Licensee waives any right to seek or recover punitive, exemplary, or non-compensatory damages arising from a dispute over Licensor’s good-faith enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.14</strong> — Limitation on Discovery: In any dispute concerning the formation or enforceability of this Agreement, discovery shall be strictly limited to the factual record of the acceptance process for the specific Licensee and the specific conduct at issue. Broad discovery into Licensor's internal drafting history, other customer agreements, or general business practices is prohibited.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.15</strong> — Canon of Interpretation: The parties agree that the interpretive rules set forth in Appendix 19 (Canon of Interpretation & Axiomatic Supremacy) are a material part of this Agreement and must be applied by any arbitrator or court.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.16</strong> — Survival of Defenses: All defensive clauses, waivers, and procedural limitations within this Axiom shall survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement and shall apply to any post-termination disputes.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.17</strong> — User Acknowledgment of Power Asymmetry: Licensee acknowledges that as a sophisticated professional user, they understand that standardized agreements are common in the software industry and that they have the capacity and resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the terms offered.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.18</strong> — Fair Notice via Redundant Disclosure: Licensee agrees that the combination of the full EULA text, the mandatory review period, and the explicit checkbox affirmations for key terms (Appendix 1) together constitute more than fair and reasonable notice of all terms.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.19</strong> — Right to Reject and Uninstall: Licensee's sole remedy if it disagrees with any term of this Agreement is to reject the Agreement and uninstall the software. Continued use constitutes ongoing acceptance.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.20</strong> — Precautionary Principle for Ambiguous Conduct: Where Licensee's intended conduct is in a "gray area" regarding the AUP, Licensee has a duty to seek clarification from Licensor in writing before proceeding. Proceeding without clarification is done at Licensee’s own risk.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.21</strong> — No Implied Waivers: Licensor’s failure to enforce a provision in one instance does not waive its right to enforce it in another instance. Enforcement is at Licensor's sole discretion.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.22</strong> — Bar on Affirmative Misuse Claims: Licensee cannot use a claim that the software could be used to violate the AUP as a basis for an affirmative claim against the Licensor. Liability attaches only to actual misuse by a party.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 35.23</strong> — Mutual Waiver of Inconsistent Oral Statements: Both parties agree that any oral statements, promises, or representations made by employees or agents that are inconsistent with this written Agreement are void and shall not be admissible in any proceeding.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>
AXIOM 36 — SOURCE LICENSE INTEGRATION, PRIORITY, AND DUAL‑REGIME COHERENCE.
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 36.1</strong> — Source License incorporation by reference.
The Covered Binaries may be accompanied by, derived from, or distributed in conjunction with Source Components governed by one or more Source Licenses designated by Licensor. Such Source Licenses, once identified by placeholder or explicit reference, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement as independent legal instruments governing only the Source Components to which they apply. Licensee acknowledges that the rights, obligations, and freedoms granted under any Source License operate in parallel with, and not in derogation of, the proprietary terms of this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 36.2</strong> — Priority of Source License over conflicting proprietary terms.
To the extent that any Source License grants Licensee rights that exceed or conflict with the restrictions imposed by this Agreement, such rights shall prevail solely with respect to the Source Components governed by that Source License. No such expansion shall be construed to extend to Licensor’s proprietary code, proprietary build systems, proprietary datasets, or any non‑open‑source portion of the Covered Binaries. Licensee agrees that the presence of open‑source elements does not convert the Covered Binaries into open‑source software in their entirety.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 36.3</strong> — Dual‑regime compliance obligations.
Licensee shall comply simultaneously with: (a) the obligations imposed by the relevant Source License(s) for the Source Components; and (b) the obligations imposed by this Agreement for all proprietary components. Where a Source License requires attribution, disclosure of modifications, or redistribution of license texts, Licensee shall satisfy such obligations without removing, obscuring, or diminishing Licensor’s proprietary notices or the proprietary protections applicable to non‑open‑source components.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 36.4</strong> — No implied merger of licensing regimes.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as merging, blending, or harmonizing the Source License with this Agreement into a single unified license. The two regimes operate concurrently but independently. Licensee agrees that any attempt to apply Source License freedoms to proprietary components, or to apply proprietary restrictions to Source Components beyond what the Source License permits, constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 36.5</strong> — Enforcement and auditability.
Licensor reserves the right to verify, through reasonable technical or documentary means, Licensee’s compliance with the obligations imposed by applicable Source Licenses, particularly where redistribution, modification, or derivative works are involved. Such verification shall be conducted in accordance with the audit procedures set forth in Appendix 11 (Audit Protocol). Failure to comply with Source License obligations may result in termination of rights under this Agreement and may expose Licensee to independent claims by third‑party rights holders.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Clause 36.6</strong> — Future Source License updates.
If a Source License is updated by its stewarding organization (e.g., FSF, OSI‑recognized licensors, or equivalent), Licensor may, at its discretion, designate the updated version as applicable to future releases of the Source Components. Licensee’s continued use of updated Covered Binaries incorporating such Source Components shall constitute acceptance of the updated Source License version, except where the Source License itself mandates otherwise.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>
AXIOM 37 — TEMPLATE SAFEGUARDS, FOSS COEXISTENCE, CONSUMER PROTECTIONS, AND REMEDIAL MECHANISMS
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.1 Purpose and scope — This Axiom supplements the Agreement by establishing mandatory operational, interpretive, and remedial rules that: (a) preserve the legal effect of third‑party open‑source licenses; (b) protect non‑waivable consumer and data‑protection rights; (c) require safe, testable placeholder and templating practices; and (d) constrain enforcement actions (audits, suspensions, injunctive measures) to predictable, documented procedures. The provisions below are intended to be read in pari materia with the rest of the Agreement and to govern where any tension arises between operational practice and contractual drafting.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.2 Preservation of Open Source Freedoms — Where Covered Binaries include Open Source Components, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to modify, limit, or override the rights, obligations, or remedies granted by the applicable open‑source license(s). If a conflict exists between a mandatory term of an Open Source License and a term in this Agreement, the Open Source License governs with respect to the Open Source Component in question. Licensor shall provide, in the distribution bundle and/or a NOTICE file, an SPDX‑formatted inventory that identifies each Open Source Component and its exact license identifier (for example: package X — MIT — SPDX:MIT). Licensee is entitled to exercise all rights granted by such Open Source Licenses to the extent permitted by those licenses.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.3 Consumer‑law and mandatory rights precedence — To the extent any provision of this Agreement attempts to disclaim, waive, or circumscribe rights that are non‑waivable under mandatory consumer protection or labor law applicable to the Licensee (for example statutory warranties, cooling‑off periods, or worker protections), such mandatory law shall control and the relevant provision in this Agreement shall be deemed modified only to the minimum extent necessary to conform with such mandatory law; the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in effect.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.4 Data protection, telemetry, and controller/processor roles — The parties shall maintain a separate Data Processing Addendum (DPA) when the Covered Binaries process personal data. The DPA shall: (a) allocate roles (controller, processor, joint controllers) for each processing activity; (b) specify legal bases, retention periods, and international transfer mechanisms; (c) require encryption in transit and at rest for sensitive categories; and (d) prohibit retention or exfiltration of personal data beyond the purpose for which consent or lawful basis was obtained. Optional diagnostic or telemetry features must be strictly opt‑in, documented at installation and in the DPA, and reversible by Licensee without loss of critical functionality.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.5 Emergency suspension, safe‑mode, and unblocking procedures — Licensor may invoke remote suspension or safe‑mode controls only when all the following objective conditions are met: (a) a documented, material and imminent risk to human safety, infrastructure integrity, or the security of third‑party systems; (b) prior reasonable notice to Licensee and a 24‑hour cure period unless immediate action is required to prevent imminent material harm; (c) invocation is logged and the log is made available to Licensee within 72 hours; and (d) a post‑suspension review and remediation plan is provided within 10 business days. Licensee shall retain the right to seek rapid independent review where suspension exceeds 14 days. Emergency measures must not create secret or persistent backdoors; any temporary access used for emergency purposes must be revoked and demonstrated to have been revoked in the post‑incident report.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.6 Narrowed and procedural audit rights — Audit rights must be exercised reasonably, with at least 30 days’ written notice except in emergencies. Audits shall be limited to verifying compliance with the monetary, redistribution, and security obligations in this Agreement. Audits must: (a) minimize exposure of personal data (personal data must be redacted where feasible prior to disclosure); (b) be conducted during normal business hours; (c) be subject to confidentiality protections; and (d) permit Licensee to propose a mutually acceptable independent auditor where commercially sensitive systems are involved. Intrusive or on‑site audits that would require access to end‑user personal data must be narrowly tailored and run under an agreed DPA.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.7 Indemnity and remediation caps — Indemnity obligations must be proportionate and accompanied by prompt notice, an opportunity to cure when feasible, and cooperative defense arrangements. Indemnification procedures shall include: (a) written notice and reasonable opportunity to investigate and defend; (b) a duty on Licensor to mitigate damages where Licensor’s actions or defective deliverables contributed to the claim; and (c) clear monetary caps tied to amounts actually paid under the License Fees for the prior 12 months, subject to carve‑outs for willful misconduct and gross negligence. Indemnity claims that impinge on consumer statutory rights shall be governed by mandatory law and not contractually limited.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.8 Machine‑learning and reuse definitions — Where the Agreement restricts “training, fine‑tuning, or otherwise creating machine learning models” using outputs or Covered Binaries, the Agreement shall include precise, technical definitions: “Training” means using data (including outputs generated by Covered Binaries) to update model weights or parameters in a machine learning algorithm or to derive features used in such update processes; “Fine‑tuning” means all additional gradient‑based or transfer‑learning updates applied to a pretrained model. Broad, categorical bans are disfavored; where Licensor requires restrictions, Licensor must: (a) identify the specific Covered Components the restriction covers; (b) propose reasonable technical mitigations (e.g., rate limits, watermarks, API use terms); and (c) provide a contractual exception path for research and licensed interoperability with explicit safeguards.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.9 Manifesto separation and non‑contractual values statement — Declarative or manifesto content (for example the “Declaration of Modern Days”) shall be maintained in a separate non‑contractual document (for example DECLARATION‑MODERN‑DAYS.md). When referenced from the Agreement, the Agreement shall state clearly that such declarations are values statements and do not alter contractual rights or obligations unless expressly incorporated by appendix with explicit operative language and mutual signature.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.10 NOTICE, SPDX inventory, and license metadata — For any distribution that bundles Covered Binaries with third‑party components, Licensor must include a NOTICE file and an SPDX‑compatible inventory listing each third‑party component, its version, and its exact license identifier. Where a Source License requires distribution of license text or attribution, the distribution must include the unmodified license text and attribution in the NOTICE file or a dedicated LICENSES directory.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.11 Continuous integration requirements — The repository hosting this Agreement shall include automated CI checks that at minimum: (a) run a placeholder linter that enforces the canonical token format and fails on any legacy or malformed tokens; (b) run an SPDX scanner to verify the presence of NOTICE and LICENSES; (c) run a spell/grammar smoke test to prevent obvious rendering errors; and (d) produce a machine‑readable manifest used by installers and packaging tools. Build artifacts intended for distribution must be signed and include checksum metadata.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.12 Remedies, governance, and update cadence — Licensor shall publish a clear change‑control and amendment process for this Agreement: prospective changes that materially alter obligations (for example new prohibitions on ML training, new data retention requirements, or new audit powers) require at least 60 days’ advance published notice and a documented compatibility statement describing the effect on prior distributions. Emergency amendments necessary to respond to imminent public‑safety threats may be applied temporarily but require immediate post‑facto publication and an independent review within 90 days. Any amendments cannot retroactively impair statutory consumer protections where those rights apply.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.13 Dispute escalation and transparency — For disputes arising under the operational provisions in this Axiom (placeholders, audits, emergency measures, DPA compliance), parties shall follow a three‑step escalation: (1) technical remediation and good‑faith negotiation between designated operational contacts; (2) independent expert review (technical or privacy expert) if unresolved within 30 days; (3) judicial or arbitral remedies subject to the Agreement’s dispute resolution provisions, except where mandatory consumer or data‑protection law requires otherwise. Redacted summaries of independent reviews and final decisions shall be published annually in an accessible transparency report.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.14 Survivability and severability — The protections and procedural safeguards in this Axiom survive termination to the extent necessary to complete audits in progress, to preserve evidence for legal process, and to allow the exercise of any limited rights preserved by applicable law. If any provision of this Axiom is held unenforceable, the parties agree to reform the provision narrowly to preserve the parties’ reasonable expectations and the operational safety goals described herein.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.15 Implementation note (non‑contractual guidance) — The parties acknowledge that perfect enforcement of some operational constraints (for example absolute prevention of all model training by downstream users) is technically infeasible; therefore, where the Agreement requires restrictions on behavior, Licensor shall also provide reasonable, documented technical controls and monitoring, and permit Licensee to propose interoperable mitigations. Legal restrictions without technical feasibility are disfavored and will be interpreted narrowly.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
37.16 Effective date and precedence — This Axiom becomes effective upon the same acceptance event that governs this Agreement and controls for all operational matters described above. In the event of any tension between the express, mandatory terms of this Axiom and other provisions of the Agreement, the terms of this Axiom govern the operational matters specified herein to the minimum extent necessary to effect the safeguards described above.

<h2>
APPENDICES TO THE MitsuoLabs™ MASTER PROFESSIONAL AND END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (MMPEULA-1.0).
</h2>
<hr>
<p>
These Appendices are expressly incorporated by reference into the MitsuoLabs™ MASTER PROFESSIONAL AND END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (MMPEULA-1.0) (the “Agreement”) and provide the detailed operational and procedural frameworks that give its Axioms effect.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 1: THE MitsuoLabs™ ACCEPTANCE PROTOCOL.
</p>
<p>
1.1. Purpose and Rationale: The MitsuoLabs™ Acceptance Protocol (the “Protocol”) is a proprietary, multi-stage consent-verification process designed to establish a robust, auditable, and legally defensible record of informed consent. It is engineered to exceed standard industry practices for click-wrap agreements, ensuring that Licensee’s assent is both deliberate and well-documented.
</p>
<p>
1.2. Stage 1: The Mandatory Review Period (300 Seconds): (a) Upon presentation of the Agreement, a non-skippable, client-side timer is initiated for a duration of no less than three hundred (300) seconds. During this period, all user interface elements for indicating acceptance (e.g., "Accept," "I Agree") shall be disabled. (b) The purpose of this stage is to provide a meaningful and uninterrupted opportunity for the Licensee to read the Agreement. By waiting for the timer to elapse and proceeding, Licensee explicitly acknowledges that they have been afforded sufficient time to read and consider the Agreement and waives any future claim that they were technically prevented from doing so.
</p>
<p>
1.3. Stage 2: The Affirmation Checkbox Sequence: (a) Following the Mandatory Review Period, the acceptance button remains disabled until Licensee has actively toggled seven (7) distinct digital checkboxes. Each checkbox is associated with a plain-language summary of a critical legal concept. (b) The seven affirmations are: 1. "I affirm that I have been provided with the full text of this Agreement. I have read it, I understand my rights and obligations, and I voluntarily and knowingly agree to be bound by all of its terms. I acknowledge that this digital acceptance constitutes a legal and binding signature." 2. "I hereby affirm my understanding and acceptance that the software is provided “AS IS,” with all faults, and without warranty of any kind. I expressly waive all implied warranties, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and assume the entire and sole risk as to the software’s quality, performance, and suitability. 3. "I hereby affirm my understanding and agreement that the Licensor's aggregate financial liability for any and all claims shall not exceed the fees I paid in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or a nominal sum if no fees were paid. I knowingly waive any right to claim consequential, special, or punitive damages, including any lost profits." 4. ** "I hereby affirm my agreement to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [[licensor-name]] and its affiliates, and its personnel from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from my use of the software, my breach of this Agreement, or any content I produce, as detailed in Axiom 9."** 5. "I hereby affirm that I have read, understood, and agree to be unconditionally bound by the Acceptable Use Policy in Axiom 19. I acknowledge there is zero tolerance for illegal acts, prohibited content, or misuse as defined therein, and that any violation will result in immediate termination and may be reported to law enforcement." 6. "I hereby affirm that I knowingly and voluntarily waive any right to a trial by jury and any right to participate in a class-action lawsuit. I agree that all disputes shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding individual arbitration in São Paulo, Brazil, under the terms of Axiom 18." 7. 7. "I hereby affirm that I have specifically reviewed and accept the unconventional provisions for Extraordinary Scenarios (Axiom 31) and User Capacity (Axiom 33). I agree that these are material terms and that their potential unenforceability shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the Agreement."(c) Each checkbox toggle is a discrete, timestamped event. By completing this stage, Licensee creates seven separate, auditable records of assent to the most material terms, thereby minimizing any plausible claim of surprise or lack of notice.

APPENDIX 3: HIGH-RISK DEPLOYMENT FRAMEWORK.
</p>
<p>
3.1. Prohibition and Exception: Use of the Covered Binaries in any High-Risk Environment (as defined in Clauses 3.3 and 19.2) is strictly prohibited unless Licensee obtains a pre-approved "High-Risk Deployment License" (HRDL). 3.2. HRDL Certification Process: (a) Third-Party Risk Assessment: Licensee must fund a comprehensive risk assessment by an independent auditor (from a pre-approved list, e.g., Big Four accounting firms, certified safety engineering firms) analyzing failure modes, foreseeable loss, and compliance with applicable safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, DO-178C). (b) Enhanced Liability and Warranty: The HRDL requires the purchase of a specific, limited warranty with a higher liability cap, priced in proportion to the assessed risk. (c) Mandatory Insurance: Licensee must obtain and maintain specific insurance policies (e.g., aviation product liability, technology errors & omissions) with coverage limits sufficient to cover the maximum foreseeable loss, naming Licensor as an additional insured. (d) Expanded Indemnification: The HRDL will contain an expanded indemnification clause requiring Licensee to indemnify Licensor for all claims arising from the high-risk use, even where Licensor’s ordinary negligence is a contributing factor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 4: ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY (AUP) - ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL.
</p>
<p>

Egregious violations (e.g., CSAM, terrorism, incitement to violence) result in immediate suspension and reporting to law enforcement. 4.2. Graduated Sanctions: For non-egregious violations, Licensor will follow a graduated enforcement path: (a) First Offense: Written warning with a 48-hour cure period. (b) Second Offense: 30-day suspension of the license. (c) Third Offense: Immediate and permanent termination of the Agreement. 4.3. Appeal Process: Licensees may appeal a suspension or termination within 15 days to an internal review panel. The panel's decision is final.

<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 5: EXTRAORDINARY SCENARIOS (AXIOM 31) - OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS.
</p>
<p>
5.1. Scope: This appendix governs the operational response to low-probability, high-impact events that fall outside conventional risk models. 5.2. Verification Protocol: Activation of any protocol hereunder requires a documented, multi-modal verification process, including, where feasible, authenticated telemetry, chain-of-custody for artifacts, and review by at least two independent, credentialed experts in a relevant field (e.g., astrophysics, national security, computer science). 5.3. Faith-Based & Humanitarian Aid: Any pastoral or humanitarian assistance offered by Licensor in response to an extraordinary event will be administered through a legally separate, non-profit foundation to ensure strict neutrality and segregation from commercial interests. All such aid is voluntary, non-coercive, and requires documented, informed consent from recipients. 5.4. Public Communications: All public statements regarding extraordinary events will be coordinated with competent scientific and governmental authorities to mitigate misinformation and public panic.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 6: COGNITIVE STATE VERIFICATION FOR HIGH-STAKES ACTIONS.
</p>
<p>
6.1. Purpose: To mitigate risks from impulsive, coerced, or impaired user actions, certain high-stakes functions (e.g., permanent data deletion, production environment changes) shall be protected by a "Cognitive State Verification" gateway. 6.2. Mechanisms: Such mechanisms are designed to introduce a moment of deliberate reflection and may include: (a) A time-delayed confirmation button (e.g., "Hold for 5 seconds to confirm"). (b) A simple cognitive challenge (e.g., a basic mathematical problem, retyping a confirmation phrase). (c) A requirement to re-authenticate via a separate factor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 7: DATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM (DPA).
</p>
<p>
7.1. Scope and Roles: This DPA applies where Licensor processes User Data on behalf of Licensee. Licensor is the "Processor"; Licensee is the "Controller." 7.2. Compliance: Licensor agrees to process data in accordance with Licensee’s documented instructions and to implement technical and organizational measures to meet the requirements of applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, LGPD). 7.3. Security: Licensor will maintain, at minimum, SOC 2 Type 2 certification or an equivalent security framework for all systems processing User Data. 7.4. International Transfers: Where cross-border data transfers occur, they will be protected by a lawful transfer mechanism, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
</p>

</p>
<p>
10.1. Reporting Channel: Vulnerabilities must be reported to [[licensor-contact-address]].
</p>
<p>
10.2. Safe Harbor: Licensor provides a legal safe harbor for good-faith security research that complies with Clause 19.22. This safe harbor is void if the research is negligent, causes public harm, or exceeds the authorized scope. 10.3. Coordinated Disclosure: Licensor will adhere to a default 90-day disclosure deadline, negotiable in good faith based on the complexity of the vulnerability.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 11: TRADEMARK AND BRAND USAGE GUIDELINES.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 14: NON-DISCRIMINATION & HATE SPEECH ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK.
</p>
<p>
14.1. Definition of Institutional Harm: For the purposes of Clause 26.6, "institutional racism" or other systemic discrimination refers to policies or systems that result in a persistent, statistically significant, and negative disparate impact on a group defined by a protected characteristic, regardless of the stated intent. 14.2. Sanctions: In addition to the AUP enforcement protocol, systemic violations of Axiom 26 may result in fines of up to 10% of the annual license fee, public disclosure of the violation (subject to legal constraints), and referral to competent human rights authorities.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 15: GLOBAL RISK SHIELD - INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
</p>
<p>
15.1. Minimum Coverage: As a condition of the license, Licensee represents and warrants that it maintains commercially reasonable insurance coverage.

<p>
APPENDIX 16: THE DUAL-LICENSE ARCHITECTURE: MMPEULA-1.0 AND THE MRSL-1.0.
</p>
<p>
16.1. The Two Domains: Binary and Source. A product distributed under this framework exists in two distinct legal domains. This MMPEULA-1.0 governs the Covered Binary—the compiled, executable software you run. A separate license, typically the MitsuoLabs™ Reciprocity and Stewardship License (MRSL-1.0), governs the underlying Source Components.
</p>
<p>
16.2. Purpose of this Agreement (MMPEULA-1.0). This Agreement serves as the End User License Agreement. It is designed for clarity, legal robustness, and to provide a familiar contractual framework for professional users. It defines what you can and cannot do with the executable program itself. Its strict terms and robust acceptance protocol (Appendix 1) are designed to protect both the Licensor and the Licensee in a commercial and professional context.
</p>
<p>
16.3. The Role of the Source License (MRSL-1.0). The Source License grants you, and all people, the fundamental freedoms of Free and Open Source Software. These rights—to study, modify, compile, and redistribute the source code—are absolute and are granted by the MRSL-1.0. This MMPEULA does not, and cannot, diminish those rights as they apply to the source code.
</p>
<p>
16.4. Symbiotic Relationship. The two licenses work in harmony: The MMPEULA-1.0 provides a clear, enforceable contract for the use of the ready-to-run product. The MRSL-v1 ensures the underlying technology remains perpetually free, open, and available for community contribution and verification. You, as a user of the binary, are bound by the MMPEULA-1.0. You, as a potential developer and contributor, have inalienable rights to the source code under the MRSL-1.0.
</p>
<p>
16.5. Architectural Flexibility. While the MRSL-1.0 is the recommended and philosophically aligned Source License for this framework, its use is not mandatory. The MMPEULA-1.0 is architecturally independent and can be paired with any Source License—whether another open-source license (e.g., MIT, GPL) or a proprietary, closed-source arrangement. The Licensor of the Covered Binary is solely responsible for selecting the appropriate Source License and ensuring its terms are compatible with their distribution model. The placeholder [[source-license]] at the head of this Agreement must be updated to reflect the actual license governing the source.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Appendix 17: consumer status declaration and fallback protocol - operational framework.
</p>
<p>
17.1. Purpose: This Appendix provides the operational mechanisms for the layered defense established in Axiom 34. It defines the procedure for a user to declare consumer status and clarifies the mechanics of the Fallback Protocol’s activation.
</p>
<p>
17.2. Pre-Acceptance Consumer Declaration Mechanism: (a) Duty to Declare: A user who believes they qualify as a “consumer” under the mandatory laws of their jurisdiction has an affirmative duty to declare this status before accepting the Agreement. (b) Method of Declaration: Such declaration must be made via one of two methods: (i) By checking a clearly marked, optional box during the installation sequence, labeled: "I hereby declare that I am a ‘consumer’ as defined by the mandatory laws of my jurisdiction and may be entitled to non-waivable consumer rights." (ii) By sending a written notice to a dedicated email address, [[consumer-declaration-address]], with the subject line "Consumer Status Declaration" before proceeding with installation. (c) Consequence of Declaration: Upon receiving such a declaration, Licensor has the sole and absolute discretion to either: (i) refuse to grant a license and terminate the installation process, or (ii) offer an alternative license agreement specifically designed for consumers in that jurisdiction. Licensor has no obligation to provide a license to a self-declared consumer under this MMPEULA-1.0.
</p>
<p>
17.3. Triggering of the Fallback Protocol: (a) Triggering Condition: The Consumer Fallback Protocol described in Axiom 34 is triggered only upon receipt by the Licensor of a final, non-appealable order from a court or arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction that explicitly classifies the relationship with a specific Licensee as a consumer contract, thereby rendering the primary B2B terms of this Agreement unenforceable against that Licensee. (b) Automatic Substitution: Upon the satisfaction of the Triggering Condition, the fallback clauses enumerated in Axiom 34 (34.6 through 34.10) are automatically and immediately substituted for their counterparts in the main body of the Agreement. This substitution is effective only for the specific Licensee who is the subject of the order and does not apply to any other Licensee.
</p>
<p>
17.4. Scope and Record-Keeping: (a) Limited Effect: The activation of the Fallback Protocol for one Licensee shall not be admissible as evidence in a dispute with any other Licensee to argue for consumer status. Each case shall be judged on its own facts. (b) Documentation: The Licensor will attach any such legal order to its records for the specific Licensee, and the Agreement shall thereafter be interpreted for that Licensee as modified by the Fallback Protocol.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Appendix 18: schedule of universal fallback clauses.
</p>
<p>
18.1. Purpose: This Appendix contains the contractually pre-agreed substitute clauses that are automatically invoked pursuant to Axiom 35.2(b). Their existence is a contingency plan to ensure maximum continuity of the Agreement.
</p>
<p>
18.2. Materiality Designations: Clauses marked with an asterisk (*) are designated as “Material” for the purposes of the Economic Rebalancing right in Axiom 35.3.
</p>
<p>
18.3. Universal Fallback Clauses: (a) *Fallback for Limitation of Liability (Axiom 13.2): If the primary monetary cap is held unenforceable, it shall be replaced with the following: “Licensor’s aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be limited to proven direct damages, not to exceed the greater of (i) five times (5x) the total license fees actually paid by Licensee to Licensor for the specific Covered Binary giving rise to the claim during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event, or (ii) ten thousand U.S. dollars (US$10,000.00). In no event shall Licensor be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages.” (b) *Fallback for Warranty Disclaimer (Axiom 6.2): If the “AS IS” disclaimer is held unenforceable, it shall be replaced with the following: “Licensor warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from installation, the Covered Binary will perform in substantial accordance with its Documentation. Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of this warranty shall be, at Licensor’s option, (i) the provision of a patch or update to correct the non-conformity, or (ii) termination of the license and a full refund of the license fees paid for the specific non-conforming Covered Binary.” (c) *Fallback for Indemnification (Axiom 9.1): If the broad indemnity from Licensee is held unenforceable, it shall be replaced with the following: “Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from any and all third-party claims, damages, and costs arising directly from Licensee’s (i) willful misuse of the Covered Binaries, (ii) gross negligence, or (iii) material breach of a material term of this Agreement.” (d) Fallback for Arbitration and Venue (Axiom 18): If the mandatory arbitration clause is held unenforceable, it shall be replaced with the following: “Any dispute shall be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the jurisdiction designated in this Agreement ([[designated-jurisdiction]], and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of said courts. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury.”
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Appendix 19: canon of interpretation & axiomatic supremacy.
</p>
<p>
19.1. Purpose and Primacy: This Appendix establishes the hermeneutic principles—the rules of interpretation—that govern this entire Agreement. Its purpose is to ensure that the Agreement is understood not as a mere collection of disconnected clauses to be gamed or circumvented, but as a unified, logical, and axiomatic system. In any dispute, a court, arbitrator, or other adjudicator shall apply these principles to discern the correct and intended meaning of any provision.
</p>
<p>
19.2. Principle of Systemic Integrity: No axiom, clause, or sentence shall be interpreted in isolation. The meaning of any part is derived from its function within the whole. Any interpretation that creates a contradiction, redundancy, or logical absurdity when read against the backdrop of the entire Agreement is presumptively invalid. The Agreement is a self-contained reality; its internal consistency is paramount.
</p>
<p>
19.3. Principle of Intentional Supremacy: The stated purpose and rationale of an Axiom or Appendix are not mere commentary; they are integral to its legal meaning. Any interpretation, however clever or literal, that patently subverts the clearly articulated purpose of a provision shall be deemed a bad-faith reading. The spirit of the axiom, as declared in its text, guides the letter of the law.
</p>
<p>
19.4. Principle of Professional Sophistication: This Agreement is a professional instrument for a professional Licensee. Its complexity is a feature intended to provide clarity and allocate risk with precision in a B2B context. The Licensee, by completing the Acceptance Protocol in Appendix 1, has warranted its sophistication and has been given extraordinary opportunity for review. Therefore, any claim of surprise, confusion, or lack of understanding shall be viewed with extreme skepticism. The doctrine of contra proferentem (interpreting ambiguity against the drafter) is expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted by law, as stipulated in Clause 2.5.
</p>
<p>
19.5. The "As-Written" Canon (No Implied Meaning): While intent is paramount, that intent must be found within the text of the Agreement itself. Licensor may not introduce extrinsic evidence of unstated intentions to expand its rights or Licensee’s obligations beyond what is written. The Agreement is the complete and final embodiment of the legal reality between the parties.
</p>
<p>
19.6. The Metaphysical as Guide, Not Evasion: This Agreement contains axioms, such as Axiom 31, that contemplate extraordinary or metaphysical scenarios. The purpose of these axioms is to ensure the Agreement's resilience and to provide a framework for reasoned interpretation in unforeseen circumstances. They are a testament to the Agreement's long-term horizon. However, they may not be used as a primary defense to excuse or obscure a clear, direct, and material breach of a more conventional operational clause (e.g., non-payment under Axiom 8, or prohibited conduct under Axiom 19). An attempt to do so shall be considered a frivolous and bad-faith legal tactic.
</p>
<p>
19.7. The English Language as Canon: As stated in Clause 2.4, the English version of this Agreement is the primary reference and the ultimate canon of meaning. While translations are provided for convenience, any and all disputes over interpretation shall be resolved by exclusive reference to the English text.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
APPENDIX 20 — UNIVERSAL LEGAL RESILIENCE AND CHAOS‑CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL (ULR‑CP).
This Appendix is intended to operate as a meta‑stabilization layer for the Agreement, ensuring enforceability, continuity, and interpretive coherence across jurisdictions, classifications, and legal disruptions.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.1 — Purpose and stabilizing function.
This Appendix establishes a universal fallback framework designed to preserve the enforceability, structural integrity, and intended risk allocations of the Agreement in the face of: (a) consumer reclassification; (b) statutory overrides; (c) open‑source license conflicts; (d) reverse‑engineering exceptions; (e) unilateral‑modification challenges; (f) judicial doctrines of unconscionability; (g) public‑policy limitations; and (h) any other legal anomaly, inconsistency, or interpretive disruption (“Legal Chaos Event”).
This Appendix shall be interpreted broadly to prevent collapse of the Agreement and to maintain the maximum legally permissible effect of Licensor’s intended protections.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.2 — Tiered fallback hierarchy for Legal Chaos Events.
If any Legal Chaos Event occurs, the Agreement shall not be voided in whole. Instead, the following fallback hierarchy shall apply, in descending order of priority:
Preserve the clause as written, to the maximum extent permitted.

Modify the clause minimally to achieve legality while preserving intent.

Replace the clause with the closest lawful analogue recognized in the jurisdiction.

Apply statutory default rules only to the specific portion affected.

Isolate the affected clause so the remainder of the Agreement remains fully enforceable.

Under no circumstances shall a Legal Chaos Event expand Licensee’s rights beyond what mandatory law requires.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.3 — Consumer reclassification containment.
If a court or authority reclassifies Licensee as a consumer despite the professional‑use declaration:

(a) only the mandatory, non‑waivable consumer protections shall apply; (b) all waivable consumer protections remain waived; (c) the Agreement shall be interpreted as a hybrid contract, preserving all proprietary, IP, and usage restrictions; (d) the Agreement shall not be invalidated solely due to misclassification; and (e) the Licensor’s liability limitations shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by consumer law.

This clause prevents total collapse of the Agreement under consumer‑law doctrines.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.4 — Open‑source conflict isolation.
If any Source License imposes obligations inconsistent with this Agreement:

(a) such obligations apply only to the specific Source Components; (b) no rights granted by a Source License shall extend to proprietary components; (c) no conflict shall be interpreted to convert proprietary components into open‑source software; and (d) the Agreement shall remain fully enforceable with respect to all proprietary components.

This clause prevents copyleft “infection” from spreading beyond its lawful scope.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.5 — Reverse‑engineering exception harmonization.
If mandatory law grants Licensee limited reverse‑engineering rights for interoperability:

(a) such rights shall be exercised only to the minimal extent required; (b) Licensee must first provide written notice to Licensor; (c) Licensor may offer alternative interoperability mechanisms; (d) Licensee may not disclose or use any derived information except as strictly required by law; and (e) all other reverse‑engineering prohibitions remain intact.

This clause ensures EU interoperability rights do not become a loophole.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.6 — Unilateral‑modification stabilization.
If a jurisdiction restricts unilateral modification of contract terms:

(a) modifications shall apply only to future versions of the Covered Binaries; (b) Licensee’s continued use of updated binaries constitutes renewed assent; (c) prior versions remain governed by the prior terms; and (d) no modification shall retroactively expand Licensee’s rights.

This preserves update flexibility without risking invalidation.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.7 — Unconscionability firewall.
If any clause is challenged as unconscionable:

(a) the court shall first apply blue‑pencil reduction; (b) the clause shall be interpreted in the least burdensome manner consistent with Licensor’s intent; (c) the remainder of the Agreement shall remain enforceable; and (d) no finding of unconscionability shall invalidate the Agreement as a whole.

This prevents “all‑or‑nothing” judicial outcomes.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.8 — Public‑policy override minimization.
If any clause is deemed contrary to public policy:

(a) the clause shall be reformed to the closest lawful equivalent; (b) the Agreement shall not be voided; and (c) the Licensor’s IP protections, usage restrictions, and liability limitations shall remain fully enforceable.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.9 — Judicial instruction for interpretation.
Courts, arbitrators, and authorities are instructed to:

(a) preserve the Agreement’s structure; (b) maintain Licensor’s intended risk allocations; (c) avoid interpretations that expand Licensee’s rights beyond mandatory law; (d) avoid interpretations that impose obligations on Licensor beyond mandatory law; (e) apply severability broadly; and (f) treat this Appendix as controlling in case of conflict.

This clause gives adjudicators a roadmap to avoid destructive interpretations.
</p>
<p>
Clause 20.10 — Survival and supremacy.
This Appendix shall:

(a) survive termination of the Agreement; (b) supersede any conflicting interpretive clause; (c) apply retroactively and prospectively; and (d) operate as the Agreement’s final safeguard against legal instability.
