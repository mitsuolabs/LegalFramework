## Contribution Policy: Axiomatic Stewardship
This project follows the **Axiomatic Stewardship Policy** defined in MRSL-1.0.

By submitting a contribution (e.g., a Pull Request), you agree that:
- Your contribution is licensed under MRSL-1.0.
- You accept the **Stewardship Rider (Part II)** of MRSL-1.0.
- You become a **Steward** of your contribution, bound by the **Ethical Use Covenant (Section 25)**.

This is automatic — no separate Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required.  
Your act of contribution is your declaration of Stewardship.

## Contribution Workflow
We welcome all contributions, from typo fixes to major new sections. Please follow this workflow:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy.  
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`  
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages.  
4. **Push to Your Fork**: Upload your branch.  
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit to the main branch with a clear title and description.  

Optional: You may formalize your Stewardship in `STEWARD.md`, this strenghts your stewards rights by giving a formal verifiable timestamp & acceptance.  
Note: You may fork without accepting the Stewardship Rider and still exercise **Part I & Part III rights**.
