# Public Ledger of Stewards

## 1. The Role of a Steward

A Steward of the MitsuoLabs™ Legal Framework is an individual or organization that has contractually committed to upholding the highest ethical standards as defined in the **Stewardship Rider (Part II)** of the **MitsuoLabs™ Reciprocity and Stewardship License (MRSL-1.0)**.

By accepting the Stewardship Rider, Stewards gain significant legal protections and governance rights, and in return, they pledge not to use their contributions for any of the prohibited purposes laid out in the Ethical Use Covenant. Their name on this ledger is a permanent, public testament to that commitment.

This file serves as the official, auditable record of all Stewards. Its integrity is paramount to the governance of the framework.

**Note:** An automated CI/CD check is in place to prevent the unauthorized removal of entries from this ledger. Any pull request that attempts to remove a Steward without the explicit, signed approval of a Project Lead will be automatically rejected.
