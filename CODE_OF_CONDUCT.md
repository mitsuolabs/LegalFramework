# MitsuoLabs™ Contributor Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge and Foundational Principle

This Code of Conduct is not a separate set of rules, but a direct extension of the legal and ethical principles codified in the **MitsuoLabs™ Reciprocity and Stewardship License (MRSL-1.0)**. All participants in this project's spaces—including but not limited to contributors, maintainers, stewards, and users interacting in forums, issue trackers, and pull requests—are expected to abide by these standards. Our foundational principle is **respect**. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.

## 2. Our Standards

In line with MRSL-1.0 Axiom 26, we are committed to providing a community environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people.
*   **Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.**
*   **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.**
*   **Focusing on what is best for the community and the project,** not just individual preferences.
*   **Showing accountability for our actions,** apologizing when necessary, and learning from our mistakes.

## 3. Prohibited Conduct

This is a non-exhaustive list of conduct that is explicitly prohibited within this community. Any such behavior is considered a violation of this Code of Conduct and may be a breach of the MRSL-1.0 itself.

*   **Discrimination and Harassment:** Any conduct that demeans, degrades, or dehumanizes others on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age. This includes the promotion of extremist ideologies such as Nazism or white supremacy.
*   **Bullying and Targeted Abuse:** This includes intimidation, stalking, threats, doxxing, or orchestrating campaigns of abuse against any person or group.
*   **Hate Speech:** The use of violent or dehumanizing language, slurs, or symbols that celebrate or glorify hateful movements.
*   **Unprofessional Conduct:** Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   **Sexual Harassment:** Unwelcome sexual attention or advances, or the use of sexualized language or imagery.

We have zero tolerance for institutional racism, state-sponsored discrimination, or discriminatory policies, even when advocated for by public figures or institutions. Coded language, euphemisms, or "dog whistles" intended to produce discriminatory outcomes are treated as explicit violations.

## 4. Enforcement and Reporting

### Reporting Violations

If you are subject to or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have any other concerns, please **immediately** report the matter via email to:

### Enforcement Actions

If the project maintainers determine, after a good-faith review, that a participant has violated this Code of Conduct, they may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban from all project spaces. All enforcement decisions will be documented.

## 5. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, both online and offline, including the repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and any other forums the project may establish. It also applies in private communications when an individual is representing the project or its community.
