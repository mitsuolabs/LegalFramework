## Why This Framework Exists: A New Covenant for the Digital Age

The legal tools of the 20th century are failing the technological realities of the 21st. Existing licenses are ill-equipped for artificial intelligence, planetary-scale surveillance, decentralized systems, and the existential risks of unaccountable technology. The MitsuoLabs™ Legal Framework was created to fill this void.

It is not merely a set of licenses; it is a **moral and legal operating system** designed to ensure that the technologies that shape our future are bound by principles of justice, stewardship, and human dignity. It is for builders who recognize that **invention without stewardship is negligence**, and for communities that demand a more equitable and resilient digital commons.

## Who Is This Framework For?

*   **For the Principled Startup:** Build a competitive moat based on ethics and trust. The MRSL-1.0 signals your commitment to responsible innovation, while the MMPEULA-1.0 provides the professional-grade legal armor you need to commercialize with confidence.

*   **For the Open-Source Maintainer:** Protect your work from exploitation. The MRSL-1.0’s reciprocity clauses ensure that derivatives of your project remain open, while the optional Stewardship Rider provides a path to legal protection and sustainability that older licenses lack.

*   **For the Enterprise Legal Team:** Mitigate future risk with unparalleled clarity. The MMPEULA's axiomatic structure and the framework's future-proof provisions provide a stable, predictable, and defensible foundation for deploying and managing software in a volatile technological landscape.

*   **For the Scholar and Activist:** This is more than a license; it's a field of study. The framework’s detailed documentation, ethical covenants, and academic-grade comparative analysis make it a powerful tool for researching, teaching, and advocating for a more just digital world.

## The Dual-License Architecture

The framework’s core innovation is its dual-license structure, which cleanly separates the governance of source code from the governance of compiled binaries. This provides both maximum freedom and maximum legal robustness.

```
  [ SOURCE CODE ]
        |
(Governed by MRSL-1.0)
 (Freedom & Ethics)
        |
     compiles
        |
        v
[ EXECUTABLE BINARY ]
        |
 (Governed by MMPEULA-1.0)
(Professional & Commercial Use)

```

This symbiosis allows a project to be both **truly FOSS at its foundation** and **commercially sound in its distribution**.

## Key Innovations

*   **A Revolutionary Ethical Bargain:** The optional Stewardship Rider allows contributors to adopt an **Ethical Use Covenant** in exchange for powerful legal protections, including patent indemnification.

*   **Unprecedented Legal Clarity:** The MMPEULA is organized into meticulous "Axioms" that replace legal ambiguity with engineering precision, providing a stable foundation for B2B transactions.

*   **The Alexandria Clause:** A binding commitment to the long-term, durable preservation of the legal texts and source code in the world's most respected archives.

*   **Future-Proof by Design:** Explicitly engineered to govern emerging technologies, with unique protocols for **Extraordinary Scenarios** like temporal anomalies or contact with non-human intelligence.

## Core Principles: Highlights from the Declaration

This framework is animated by the non-binding **Declaration of Modern Days — V1 (2026)**. These are the guiding stars for the legal engineering of the entire system.

> **1. Stewardship of Life.** Design decisions must account for ecological limits. Regeneration, not extraction, is our baseline.
>
> **8. Safety and Duty to Repair.** We accept moral responsibility for harms. Preserve evidence, report transparently, remediate swiftly, and compensate where appropriate. Concealment is a breach.
>
> **32. The Duty to Act (Against Omission).** We reject the sin of omission. Knowing of a harm and failing to act is complicity. Silence is not neutrality; it is a choice.

## A Resource for Legal and Academic Pioneers

This framework is a scholarly resource. The `docs/` directory contains **extensive comparative analysis** of the MRSL-1.0 against dozens of other major open-source and ethical-source licenses. The meticulous structure of the licenses is designed to be studied, debated, and built upon, serving as a rich case study in modern legal engineering.

## Resilient and Transparent Development

This project is committed to extreme operational resilience and long-term preservation.

*   **Redundant, Mirrored Development:** This repository is continuously mirrored between **GitHub** and **GitLab**. Our CI/CD pipeline automates this mirroring, ensuring the project is not dependent on a single commercial entity.

*   **The Alexandria Clause:** In accordance with Section 19 of the MRSL-1.0, we submit every major release to a distributed network of the world’s most respected archival institutions, including **Software Heritage**, the **Internet Archive**, the **Bodleian Libraries at Oxford**, **Harvard & Yale Law Libraries**, **IPFS**, and a **Tor Onion Service**.

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Adopt the Ethical Foundation (MRSL-1.0):**
    *   To guarantee your source code remains free and ethically bound, place the `mrsl-1.0.txt` file in your repository as `LICENSE`.
    *   Use the templates in the MRSL-1.0 Appendices to create your `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `STEWARD.md` files.

2.  **Distribute with Professional Confidence (MMPEULA-1.0):**
    *   To distribute your compiled software with professional-grade legal protection, use `mmpeula-1.0.txt` as your EULA template.
    *   Implement the **MitsuoLabs™ Acceptance Protocol** (Appendix 1) in your installer to ensure robust, documented consent.
