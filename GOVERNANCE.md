# Project Governance Model

## 1. Guiding Principles

The governance of the MitsuoLabs™ Legal Framework is designed to be transparent, accountable, and predictable. It reflects the serious nature of the project and ensures that its integrity is maintained over the long term. Our model is one of meritocratic stewardship, where influence is earned through contribution and commitment to the project's foundational principles.

## 2. Project Roles and Responsibilities

This project has three officially recognized roles, which can and do overlap.

### 2.1. Project Leads

The Project Leads are the ultimate custodians and final authorities of the framework. They hold the final say on all strategic decisions, including the approval of major roadmap changes, the appointment of Maintainers, and the ultimate enforcement of the licenses.

*   **Current Project Leads:**
    *   MitsuoLabs™
    *   Daniel Mitsuo

### 2.2. Maintainers

Maintainers are highly trusted individuals responsible for the day-to-day management and technical integrity of the repository. Their responsibilities include:

*   Reviewing and merging pull requests.
*   Managing the CI/CD pipeline and other repository automation.
*   Triaging issues and managing the project backlog.
*   Upholding the Code of Conduct and enforcing moderation policies.
*   Appointing new Maintainers, subject to the approval of the Project Leads.

*   **Current Maintainers:**
    *   MitsuoLabs™
    *   Daniel Mitsuo

### 2.3. Stewards

Stewards are the core of the project community. A Steward is any individual or organization that has made a contribution to the framework and is therefore contractually bound by the MRSL-1.0 Stewardship Rider. The official list of Stewards is maintained in the `STEWARD.md` file.

*   **Current Stewards:**
    *   MitsuoLabs™
    *   Daniel Mitsuo

## 3. Decision-Making Process

To ensure transparency and allow for community input, the following process will be used for significant changes to the framework.

*   **Major Proposals:** Any proposal that materially alters the legal text of the licenses, changes the governance model, or makes a significant change to the project roadmap must be submitted as a GitHub Issue with the `[PROPOSAL]` tag.
*   **Review Period:** The proposal will be open for public comment for a minimum of **14 days**.
*   **Prioritized Feedback:** During the review period, feedback from **Stewards** will be given the highest priority and consideration by the Maintainers and Project Leads.
*   **Final Decision:** The final decision on the proposal will be made by the **Project Leads** after reviewing all community feedback. The decision and its rationale will be documented in the original issue.
*   **Emergency Fixes:** Maintainers may merge critical fixes (e.g., for typos, broken links, or minor security issues) without a formal review period, but will provide a clear post-facto notice to the community.

## 4. The Integrity of the Steward Ledger

The `STEWARD.md` file is the immutable public record of ethical commitment and is fundamental to this project's governance. The process for amending it is as follows:

*   **Adding a Steward:** A new contributor may add their name to the ledger as part of their first pull request. This addition will be reviewed and merged by a Maintainer.
*   **Removing a Steward:** The removal of a Steward is a significant event and can only occur under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., a demonstrable breach of the Ethical Use Covenant or a formal request from the Steward). Any pull request to remove a Steward requires the explicit, documented approval of a **Project Lead** before it can be merged.

## 5. Amending This Document

Any proposed changes to this `GOVERNANCE.md` document are considered a Major Proposal and must follow the full decision-making process outlined in Section 3.
