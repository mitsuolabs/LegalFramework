# MRSL-1.0 vs. The PolyForm Licenses (Archetype): A Comparative Analysis

## 1. Scholarly Overview of The PolyForm Project

The PolyForm Project is not a single license, but a generator that allows projects to create a variety of customized "source available" licenses. These licenses are explicitly *not* open source. They are designed for projects that want to share their source code publicly but with specific restrictions that are not allowed by the Open Source Definition.

PolyForm offers several standard templates, such as:

*   **PolyForm Noncommercial:** Prohibits any commercial use.
*   **PolyForm Internal Use:** Allows use only within the licensee's organization.
*   **PolyForm Shield:** A license similar to the SSPL, designed to prevent others from offering the software as a commercial service.
*   **PolyForm Strict:** A highly restrictive license for evaluation purposes only.

These licenses provide clarity and standardization for various models of source-available software, but they are fundamentally proprietary in nature.

## 2. Detailed Feature Comparison Matrix

| Domain | Feature | The PolyForm Licenses (Archetype) | MitsuoLabs Framework (MRSL-1.0) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FOSS Compliance** | **No (by design).** PolyForm licenses are explicitly source-available, not open source. | **Yes (by Design):** MRSL-1.0 is architected to be fully FOSS-compliant. Part I is a standalone, OSI-approved license. |
| **Primary Goal** | **Strategic Intent** | **Commercial Control:** To allow for the sharing of source code while retaining tight control over its use, typically to drive revenue through a separate commercial license. | **Sustainable Commons:** To build a self-sustaining, collaborative open source commons protected by strong reciprocity and incentivized partnership. |
| **Freedoms** | **Right to Use** | **Restricted:** The core purpose is to restrict use (e.g., no commercial use, no public hosting). | **Unrestricted (in Part I):** Part I grants the universal right to use the software for any purpose, including commercial use. Restrictions only apply to Stewards under the optional Part II. |
| **Sustainability** | **Model** | **Dual-Licensing:** The source-available license is used to drive users to purchase a less restrictive commercial license. | **Incentivized Stewardship:** Uses the promise of valuable legal protections (like patent indemnification) to attract voluntary contributions and partnerships from commercial users. |

## 3. Academic & Strategic Analysis

The PolyForm licenses and MRSL-1.0 are both sophisticated legal tools, but they serve opposite ends. PolyForm is for building a wall around source code to control it; MRSL-1.0 is for building a constitutional framework to set it free sustainably.

#### **PolyForm: The Controlled Source Model**

The strategy behind PolyForm is to give developers the tools to share their source code without giving away their ability to sell it. It is the legal toolkit for a dual-licensing business model. By offering a free-of-charge license that is highly restrictive (e.g., PolyForm Noncommercial), the developer can attract individual users and build a community, while forcing any commercial user to come to them to purchase a traditional proprietary license.

It is an honest and clear way to run a source-available business. It does not pretend to be open source. It is about retaining control.

#### **MRSL-1.0: The Open Commons Model**

MRSL-1.0 is designed to achieve commercial sustainability without resorting to a restrictive, proprietary model. It is fundamentally about building a true open source commons.

1.  **Freedom First:** Where PolyForm restricts, MRSL-1.0 liberates. **Part I** of the license is pure FOSS. It guarantees the right to commercial use to everyone. This is the opposite of the PolyForm Noncommercial model. MRSL-1.0 is built on the belief that a vibrant ecosystem requires commercial participation.

2.  **Sustainability Through Incentives, Not Restrictions:** PolyForm's model is to restrict use to create a need for a paid license. MRSL-1.0's model is to offer valuable benefits to create a *desire* for partnership. Instead of saying "You can't use this commercially without paying me," MRSL-1.0 says "You can use this commercially for free, but if you choose to partner with the project by becoming a **Steward**, we will give you powerful legal protections like **patent indemnification (§26.a)**." This is a positive-sum, incentive-based model, not a zero-sum, restriction-based one.

3.  **True FOSS, True Collaboration:** Because MRSL-1.0 is a true FOSS license, it fosters genuine collaboration. Companies can build on it, integrate it, and contribute back without fear of running afoul of a "non-commercial" clause. The Stewardship model then provides a structured way for that collaboration to become a formal, mutually beneficial partnership.

## 4. Conclusion

*   **Choose a PolyForm License** when your business model is based on **dual-licensing**. You want to share your source code for transparency or to build a community, but you need to retain strict control over its commercial use in order to sell proprietary licenses. You are running a source-available, not an open source, project.

*   **Choose MRSL-1.0** when you want to build a **true, commercially viable open source project**. Its framework is designed to foster a vibrant, collaborative commons that includes commercial users, and its unique Stewardship model provides a powerful, modern mechanism for achieving financial sustainability through partnership and incentives, not restrictions.
