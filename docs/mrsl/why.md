# Why Use the MRSL?

The MitsuoLabs™ Reciprocity and Stewardship License (MRSL-1.0) was created to address the evolving challenges of the modern software landscape. While traditional FOSS licenses like the GPL and MIT are foundational, they were not designed for the age of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and widespread ethical challenges. The MRSL-1.0 is a next-generation FOSS-Compatible Ethical-Source license that preserves the core principles of open source while providing robust solutions for today's world.

## The Problem with Existing FOSS Licenses

1.  **The "SaaS Loophole":** Strong copyleft licenses like the GPL require you to share your source code when you *distribute* the software. However, if you run a modified version on a server and sell access to it (Software as a Service), you are not distributing the software, so you have no obligation to share your changes. The AGPL addresses this, but it is not as widely adopted.

2.  **Ethical Concerns:** Traditional FOSS licenses are famously amoral. They explicitly permit the use of the software for any purpose, including those that may be unethical or harmful. This has led to the rise of "ethical source" licenses, but many of them are not FOSS-compatible and create legal complexity.

3.  **Lack of Legal Protection for Contributors:** Contributing to FOSS projects can be risky. Contributors often have little to no legal protection if their work is involved in a patent dispute or if they are sued.

## The MRSL-1.0 Solution: A Modern License for a Modern Era

The MRSL-1.0 is a pure FOSS-Compatible Ethical-Source license that offers a powerful, integrated solution to these problems.

### 1. Closes the SaaS Loophole

The MRSL-1.0 includes a **Network Reciprocity** clause (Section 6) that requires anyone running a modified version of the software as a network service to make their source code available to users of that service. This ensures that the benefits of open source extend to the cloud.

### 2. An Optional Path for Ethical Stewardship

The MRSL-1.0 introduces a unique, two-part structure:

-   **Part I: The Core FOSS License:** This is a strong copyleft license that is fully FOSS-compatible. Anyone can use the software under these terms for any purpose.
-   **Part II: The Stewardship Rider:** This is an *optional* agreement. Contributors can choose to become "Stewards" by publicly declaring their acceptance of an **Ethical Use Covenant**. This covenant prohibits them from using their own contributions for a clear and limited set of harmful activities.

This model provides the best of both worlds: the project remains fully FOSS, but it also creates a community of contributors who are committed to the software's ethical use.

### 3. Real Legal Protection for Stewards

In exchange for accepting the Ethical Use Covenant, Stewards receive significant legal benefits that are almost unheard of in the FOSS world, including:

-   **Patent Grants and Indemnification:** Stewards receive a patent license and are indemnified against certain patent infringement claims.
-   **Mutual Indemnification:** Stewards agree to defend each other against claims related to their contributions.
-   **A Stronger, Safer Community:** This creates a powerful incentive for responsible developers to contribute, knowing they have a degree of legal protection.

In essence, the MRSL-1.0 is for developers who believe in the power of open source but also believe that freedom comes with responsibility. It provides a way to build a thriving, collaborative, and ethical FOSS community for the 21st century.
